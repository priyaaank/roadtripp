summary: "A 15-day road trip through Himachal Pradesh, winding through pine-scented forests, apple orchards, and snow-kissed mountains. From the bohemian charm of Kasol and the quiet orchards of Thanedar to the bustling lanes of Manali and the colonial echoes of Dalhousie, each stop brought its own flavor. We wandered through Tibetan monasteries in McLeodganj, soaked in the serenity of Jibhi, and breathed in the crisp air of Tirthan Valley. A journey of winding roads, cozy homestays, and endless chai breaks‚ÄîHimachal unfolded like a slow, soulful melody"

    description: "We kicked off our adventure on a Friday, flying from Bengaluru to Delhi. The plan was simple: land in Delhi at night, stay overnight, pick up our rental car, and hit the road early the next morning. We left for the airport around 2:30 pm, carrying a fair bit of luggage, including a child seat to make the long road trip more comfortable for our younger one. Thankfully, IndiGo allowed it as an extra item without any hassle. The flight was smooth. We kept the kids fed and entertained, and landed in Delhi around 11:00 pm. Our hotel, however, was a disappointment. The listing had made it seem like it was in Aerocity, but it turned out to be in Mahipalpur, in a dingy part of town. Still, since it was just a night halt, we let it slide. We settled in, ordered some forgettable food, and got ready to call it a night. Meanwhile, I headed out to pick up our rental car from RBTS. We had originally booked a Hyundai Exter but were given a Suzuki Fronx instead, same segment and also automatic, so no complaints. Given the late hour, I appreciated that someone was available for the handover. The car was fairly new, with about 22,000 km on the odometer. Apart from a few minor quirks, everything looked good. The RBTS team was helpful when I had some questions. I got back to the hotel, and we all went to bed, ready to begin our road trip bright and early the next morning between 6‚Äì7 am<br/><br/>BTW, We would highly recommend <a href='https://www.rbtsselfdrive.com/' target='_new'>RBTS self drive</a> car rental service. They have new cars and a wide variety of range. The support and service is fantastic. "

      review: "Misleading pictures and misrepresented location by saying that it is near airport. This is in Mahipalpur and not in Aerocity. Budget hotel and lack of hygiene in the bathrooms. Suspicious linen in the room. That being said the rooms themselves were decently large and we did not have to pay for the extra bed. Food, as expected, was bit underwhelming. Do not recommend"
    additional_considerations: "We would highly recommend RBTS self drive car rental service. They have new cars and a wide variety of range. The support and service is fantastic. Even if you are looking to stay, look for a hotel in Aerocity and verify location"

    description: "We kicked off Day 2 bright and early, leaving the hotel around 7 am. After sorting out a few small car niggles, we hit the highway with empty stomachs and eager faces. A late breakfast stop at the iconic Amrik Sukhdev in Murthal was just what we needed‚Äîhot tandoor chai and their famous tandoori parathas were so good that we couldn‚Äôt stop at just one. Let‚Äôs just say the carb-load was real! üçµü•ò From there, the drive was smooth and scenic, about seven hours in total with breaks. The route took us past Panipat, Ambala, and Zirakpur near Chandigarh before the landscape began to change. After crossing Parwanoo, the wide highways gave way to gentle curves and pine-scented air‚Äîthe first signs that we were truly in the hills. We even spotted rivers along the way, making the drive all the more enjoyable. By around 3:45 pm, we rolled into Kasauli. After checking into our hotel and settling in, we took a leisurely stroll through the town and into the cantonment area. Due to a forest fire in the nearby jungles, the treks were closed, but that didn‚Äôt stop us from catching a gorgeous sunset over the hills. The day wrapped up with a comforting dinner and an early night, our tired bodies happy to finally be in the mountains."

    description: "Our Day 3 began with a short drive from Kasauli to <b>Subathu</b>, a quiet little cantonment town just about an hour away. Subathu has quite a history‚Äîduring the <b>Anglo-Nepalese War</b> in the early 1800s, it played a key role, and today it is home to the <b>1st and 4th Gorkha Rifles</b> of the Indian Army. We strolled around the cantonment, soaking in the calm streets and military vibe, before heading back to Kasauli. </br><br/> Back in town, we stopped by the <b>Church of England</b> near Mall Road, a reminder of the colonial past tucked into the hills. For lunch, we switched gears and tried something unexpected‚Äîa Korean restaurant! The bibimbap was colourful, authentic, and surprisingly comforting, a nice change from the usual hill food. </br></br> By early evening, it was time for our much-awaited walk along the <b>Gilbert Trail</b>. This narrow 2 km stretch winds along the hillside and is known for its lovely views. True to its reputation, the trail rewarded us with a spectacular <b>sunset over the valleys</b>, the kind you pause to remember. As the light faded, we traced our steps back, reading the names of martyrs on the memorial boards along the cantonment road‚Äîa quiet, reflective end to the walk. </br> </br> Dinner was a simple affair that night, as our tired legs were eager for rest. We tucked ourselves in, ready to recharge for the adventures waiting on Day 4"

    title: "Yaks, Hidden Caf√©s & the Thrill of Hatu Peak"
    date: "6 May 2024"
    featured_image: "/assets/images/himachal/day4-main.jpg"
    description: "We started Day 4 on a relaxed note, leaving Kasauli around 10 am. The plan was simple‚Äîan easy 4‚Äì5 hour drive with a stop at Hatu Peak before reaching Thanedar. About two hours into the journey, we pulled over at a tea point where locals had brought along yaks for photos and colourful costumes for kids. Naturally, our little ones were excited to try both, and we happily joined in. It turned into an impromptu roadside photoshoot with tea in hand, against the backdrop of the scenic drive. The road through Shimla (<i>we have been to Shimla before and since we felt it was too commercial for us, it was not part of our itinerary</i>) and Kufri kept us entertained with its sweeping views. Just before Kufri, we made a quick photo stop before continuing on. For lunch, we stumbled upon a gem‚ÄîKhadu Caf√© near Nanni village in Matiana. With its rustic charm, local flavours, and freshly cooked food, this was easily one of the best food finds of our entire trip. The highlights? Sweet and savoury sattu, pahadi aloo, kadhi chawal, rajma chawal, and a soul-warming lemon-ginger-honey tea. Everything was authentic and bursting with flavour‚Äîwe‚Äôd go back just for this! Post-lunch, we drove towards Hatu Peak. At the base, locals advised us to hire a driver for the narrow, steep climb with its deep gorges on either side. But we decided to take it on ourselves. They weren‚Äôt wrong‚Äîthe single-lane mountain road was tricky and thrilling, with only one tight spot where another vehicle had to help us pass. Still, with some prior mountain driving experience, we managed fine and reached the top in about 45 minutes. The peak welcomed us with chilly winds, stunning views, and the serene Hatu Mata Temple. Just as we soaked it all in, the clouds rolled over and light rain began, adding to the magic. The descent took around an hour, and with a sense of accomplishment, we continued our drive. By 5 pm, we reached Banjara Resort in Thanedar, set amidst beautiful apple and orange orchards. The weather was cool, so sweaters and sweatshirts came out. The rooms were cozy with electric blankets‚Äîa small luxury that felt just right for the evening chill. After exploring the property and watching the sunset right from our room, we enjoyed a simple but fresh dinner at the resort‚Äôs restaurant. Tired yet content, we ended the day snuggled up in our warm beds."

Worth for a stay for a day as a mid-stop for a longer journey. Alternatively, they may be able to arrange exploration and treks nearby if the goal is to stay longer and just relax in the lap of nature. They have an huge Orange Orchard to explore. Overall, value for money and great service. Highly recommended"

    description: "Day 5 turned out to be a feast for the eyes. We began with a slow morning stroll around our stay in Thanedar, exploring its step farming and fruit orchards before setting out at 9:30 am. Our first stop was the beautiful Tani Jubbar Lake, just a short drive away. Nestled among tall fir trees, the lake shimmered under the morning sun. A gentle walk around its shaded banks, with the crisp air and soft warmth of the sun, felt like the perfect start to the day.<br/> <br/>Soon, we were back on the road towards Jibhi, our destination for the night. A road accident caused a long jam, but it turned into a happy accident for us‚Äîwe spotted roadside cherry trees heavy with fruit, and the kind owner let us pluck a few. They were easily the freshest and sweetest cherries we‚Äôve ever tasted üçí. By the time traffic cleared 30‚Äì45 minutes later, we were back to winding through mountain roads.<br/> <br/>Not long after, the Sutlej River appeared near Rhena and stayed with us for much of the journey. At one spot, we pulled over to dip our feet into its icy-cold waters ‚ùÑÔ∏è‚Äîa small but blissful break. For lunch, we stopped at a cozy caf√© called Rustic Shoja. The food was hearty and tasty, and though service was on the slower side, we didn‚Äôt mind‚Äîit had a relaxed vibe with board games to keep us entertained, and Jibhi was just half an hour away.<br/> <br/>Before checking into our stay, we made a quick stop at the Jibhi Waterfall. Tucked inside a green pocket, the waterfall was small but charming, surrounded by peaceful forest. The kids were thrilled to buy quirky roadside caps‚Äîone shaped like a mushroom head! From there, we drove to our stay, Misty Wild Homes, located just outside Jibhi. Getting there was an adventure in itself‚Äîcrossing a shallow river bed and a rocky path over a low bridge. The property had simple rooms and basic amenities, but the setting made up for it. Dinner was an easy Maggie night üçú, followed by hot baths to fight the evening chill. We tucked in early, tired but happy after a day filled with lakes, rivers, cherries, and mountain views."

      review: "The property is fairly small and if you are located on the first floor, you need to carry over your luggage. The kitchen and laundry is run by a local couple living there. The breakfast was in their kitchen, and the setting to eat it was fairly local and lovely. However the availabilty of hot water was limited and there were power cut issues. The access was a bit away from the city. While it is a beautiful location, due to lack of amanities and mediocre service, will give it 3 stars. More of a value stay, if you are looking for a shoestring budget"

    description: "Day 6 was one we had circled on the calendar. Our big trek to Serolsar Lake via Jalori Pass. Since we‚Äôd heard it gets crowded during the day, we skipped the slow breakfast at our stay in Jibhi and left sharp at 7 am. A few minutes down the road, we spotted a tiny hole-in-the-wall eatery doubling as a grocery store. It turned out to be a jackpot‚Äîhot parathas (a bit oily, but just the calorie load we needed for a 10 km trek!), fresh tea, and the quirkiest details: a breathtaking valley view from one side, and on the other, a dead snake in a jar üêç (we‚Äôre guessing for ‚Äúmedicinal purposes‚Äù‚Äîwe didn‚Äôt dare ask). <br/><br/> By 8 am, we were on the trail. The cold wind stung, with temperatures in the low single digits, but the forest trail pulled us in. The 5 km walk from Jalori Pass to Serolsar Lake meandered through dense woods, with stretches of rocky climbs. Somewhere along the way, we picked up a dog companion, clearly an old hand at scavenging tourist snacks. Closer to the lake, we took a detour uphill for a panoramic Himalayan view‚Äîa tough climb with the kids, but absolutely worth it. The little snack shacks on the trail were shut, so we had the path mostly to ourselves. <br/><br/>In about 90 minutes, we reached the emerald-green Serolsar Lake, guarded by a small temple on its banks. The water is considered sacred, so no one dares to touch it, not that we‚Äôd have braved the cold anyway! We wandered around, took in the peace, clicked plenty of photos, and rewarded ourselves with steaming Maggi and snacks at the lake before starting back. On the return, we passed a wave of trekkers heading up and felt glad we had started early‚Äîwe‚Äôd had the lake all to ourselves.<br/><br/>By late noon, we were back at the car, tired but surprisingly upbeat. Instead of calling it a day, we drove to the Tirthan Valley. Beside the river, a kind restaurant owner set up a table just for us with hot pakoras and fresh tea üçµüç≤. We sat there, feet dangling by the Tirthan River, watching the sun sink into the valley. By the time evening chill set in, our bodies were reminding us of the long trek. A quick bite on the way back, and we were in bed, proud and content. It was one of those days where the kids kept pace, spirits stayed high, and the mountains gave us memories we‚Äôll never forget."

      review: "The property is fairly small and if you are located on the first floor, you need to carry over your luggage. The kitchen and laundry is run by a local couple living there. The breakfast was in their kitchen, and the setting to eat it was fairly local and lovely. However the availabilty of hot water was limited and there were power cut issues. The access was a bit away from the city. While it is a beautiful location, due to lack of amanities and mediocre service, will give it 3 stars. More of a value stay, if you are looking for a shoestring budget"

The detour to the Himalayan viewpoint is steep‚Äîworth it if kids have the energy. The Tirthan Valley riverbank is perfect for an evening tea stop‚Äîcarry a shawl or jacket, the chill sets in quickly. Total trek is about 10 km round trip, so plan breaks for younger kids and wear good walking shoes"

    description: "We began Day 7 around 9 am with a homely breakfast at our Jibhi stay. The couple who ran the kitchen whipped up hot parathas, bread and butter, all cooked on a traditional coal heater that doubled as a stove. The food was simple but lip-smacking, and sitting on the kitchen floor while they served us felt like an authentic mountain experience.<br/><br/>Our plan for the day was to reach Manali, with a detour to Shangarh Meadow. The road up was under heavy construction, making the climb a bit bumpy and slow. But when we finally reached, the meadow was worth it‚Äîgreen, open, and paired with perfect weather. A small temple stood there, though it was closed when we arrived. With makeshift toilets available near the parking (keys obtained in exchange for a packet of biscuits from the shop outside!), and the peaceful surroundings, it felt like a good mid-way break. After about 90 minutes of soaking it all in, we continued our journey.<br/><br/>The drive onwards was every bit as scenic as the rest of Himachal. We traced the Tirthan and Beas rivers, stopping at Kullu to watch the rafting action on the gushing waters. A roadside meal followed‚Äînot extraordinary in taste, but served with stunning views that made it worthwhile. From Kullu, the climb to Manali began, and by 6 pm, we rolled into town.<br/><br/>As expected, a bit of traffic greeted us on entry, but the real surprise was the drop in temperature. The view from our hotel was a treat too‚Äîthe first time we saw snow-capped peaks looming so close. We stayed at Montana Blues Resort by Snow City, a value stay with spacious, clean rooms, mountain views, and a cozy vibe, tucked slightly inside the city. That evening, the hotel hosted a bonfire, which felt perfect in the chilly air. Dinner was light, and the humble khichdi stood out in its comfort. With travel, detours, and meadows behind us, we happily called it a night in Manali"

    featured_image: "/assets/images/himachal/day8-main.jpg"
    description: "The day began on a high note with breathtaking mountain views from our hotel‚Äôs restaurant. Excited for our first real encounter with snow, we planned a trip to Sissu. None of us had ever experienced snow up close, so spirits were high as we set out. Along the way, we realized snow isn‚Äôt all fun without the right gear‚Äîboots and snow clothes were a must to avoid getting drenched in slush.<br/><br/>On the drive, we stumbled upon a zipline setup. Safety standards looked questionable at best, but we decided to take a leap of faith. Suspended over the valley, the view was thrilling, and thankfully, we landed safely, hearts racing but smiling.<br/><br/>Soon, the road took us to the Atal Tunnel, an engineering marvel stretching over 10 km. Just before the tunnel, the area was buzzing with touristy adventure sports‚Äîyak rides, quad bikes, and crowds everywhere. Overwhelmed, we didn‚Äôt stop and drove straight through. The tunnel itself was impressive‚Äîwell built, well managed‚Äîand once out, the landscapes opened up into spectacular views. We stopped briefly near a water body for photos, but parking chaos after the tunnel made things tricky.<br/><br/>At Sissu, our snow experience was far from picture-perfect. The area was packed with tourists, the sun was blazing, and the snow was mostly muddy and slushy. Within minutes, we were wet, uncomfortable, and even a little sunburnt from the glare. Disappointed but wiser, we turned back and stopped at a riverside restaurant near the Beas River for lunch. The food was good, but long waits and high prices were reminders of peak-season crowds.<br/><br/>In the afternoon, we trekked to Jogini Waterfall. The approach was narrow, and the trek itself was steeper than expected. Lined with small shops (some openly selling hash brownies and cannabis edibles), it had its quirks. The waterfall, though underwhelming, did offer a refreshing spray and nice valley views. Sadly, litter and crowds dulled the charm. On the way back, we stopped at a small temple and hot springs, but again, it was overly crowded.<br/><br/>Back at the hotel, I managed to sneak out and get the car washed for ‚Çπ500 while the family enjoyed a bonfire. We regrouped for dinner, warmed ourselves around the fire, and called it a night. Day 8 had been long, tiring, and a bit messy, but it left us with stories and lessons‚Äîsometimes snow looks better from afar!"
    highlights:
      - "‚úÖ The zipline and the breakfast"
      - "‚úÖ The marvelous drive through Atal Tunnel and the pictureseque landscape right after. Pause and click pictures at a good spot"
      - "‚ùå The overall snow experience. It was quite a let down. Slush and poor quality gear made it sub-optimal"
      - "‚ùå Sunburnt with harsh sun and reflecting snow"
      - "‚ùå Overly crowded Manali. Made everything less enjoyable, especially with constant littering and hustle. Felt rushed everywhere"

    description: "After days of long drives and treks, Day 9 was meant to be an easy one. We started late, around 9:30 am, with a lazy breakfast at the hotel, soaking in the gorgeous mountain views one last time before heading out to explore Manali town.<br/><br/>We drove down and parked at the Mall Road parking, then climbed up the stairs through the old market‚Äîa lively maze of tiny shops and colourful chaos slowly coming to life. Our first stop for the day was the Buddhist Monastery, a peaceful oasis amidst the bustle. The prayer flags fluttered softly, and the calm atmosphere instantly set the tone for the morning.<br/><br/>Inside, the kids were fascinated by the large, vibrant statues of deities and the intricate wall paintings. We took a moment to read about Hayagriva and Guru Padmasambhava, two significant figures in Tibetan Buddhism.<br/><br/>According to legend, Hayagriva, meaning ‚Äúhorse-necked one,‚Äù is a fierce form of Lord Vishnu in Hinduism and an enlightened protector in Buddhism. Depicted with a horse‚Äôs head and human body, he symbolizes the destruction of ignorance and ego. Guru Padmasambhava, on the other hand, is known as the Second Buddha. He is believed to have brought Buddhism to Tibet in the 8th century, subduing local spirits and teaching the path of compassion and wisdom. Reading their stories against the backdrop of chanting monks and the scent of incense felt both grounding and deeply enriching.<br/><br/>When we stepped back into the daylight, the market was buzzing‚Äîshops were opening, and vendors were calling out. We wandered into a local emporium for a bit, admired the woollens and trinkets, and sampled a few sweets from a nearby halwai shop (which, unfortunately, didn‚Äôt quite live up to the expectations). We continued strolling up and down Mall Road, mostly window shopping, enjoying the mountain air and lively street scenes.<br/><br/>Next, we took an auto ride to the Hadimba Devi Temple, one of Manali‚Äôs most iconic spots. Set amidst towering deodar forests, the temple‚Äôs wooden pagoda-style architecture looked straight out of an old tale‚Äîand rightly so. Built in the 16th century, it is dedicated to Hadimba, the wife of Bhima from the Mahabharata. Legend says that Hadimba, born a demoness, fell in love with Bhima when the Pandavas took refuge in the region. After Bhima left, Hadimba stayed back, and her son Ghatotkacha later became a revered warrior. The temple stands at the spot where Hadimba meditated, and locals still consider her their guardian deity.<br/><br/>The temple grounds were buzzing with local sellers offering everything from souvenirs to ‚Äúancient herbs‚Äù and ‚Äúsanjeevani jadi booti‚Äù‚Äîwhich we looked at curiously but wisely avoided. We spent some time exploring the lush forest trails nearby before heading back to Mall Road for lunch.<br/><br/>We picked The Pahadi Caf√©, a cozy spot overlooking the street. The kids went for chicken pasta while I ordered tandoori kebabs. The food was decent, my kebabs fresh off the grill, but sadly, the pasta turned out to be a bad decision. By evening, everyone who‚Äôd eaten it started feeling queasy, and by night, our peaceful day had turned into a mini family crisis. One by one, the kids and my wife fell sick, leaving me as the lone caregiver. It was a long night‚Äîexhausting and worrisome‚Äîbut we were grateful it happened towards the end of our Manali stay and not during one of the long drives.<br/><br/>As the night stretched on, I found myself thinking‚Äîtravel days come with their share of surprises, not all pleasant, but each becomes part of the story. Tomorrow, we‚Äôd move on to Rakkar near Dharamshala, hopefully with everyone feeling better."

    description: "Day 12 began on a difficult note. The night before had been rough ‚Äî both my wife and daughter were down with what seemed like food poisoning. While my wife somehow managed to get by, our daughter was much worse, constantly throwing up and visibly weak. By morning, we knew we needed help.<br/><br/>We drove to the emergency department at Lady Willingdon Hospital in Manali, an old but well-kept place with a calm air about it. The nursing staff was kind, efficient, and reassuring ‚Äî they immediately started IV fluids and gave her an injection to stop the vomiting. Within an hour, we could see the energy returning to her face. That small smile after a long night of worry was such a relief. After resting for a few hours and ensuring she was stable, we decided to continue our journey toward Dharamshala.<br/><br/>The drive was long ‚Äî roughly eight hours ‚Äî and for the first couple of hours, everything went smoothly until we ran into a major traffic jam. There had been an accident ahead on the narrow hilly road, leaving no room for vehicles to pass. We were stuck in the same spot for nearly an hour. Just as the traffic began to move, our son suddenly got sick too. It was d√©j√† vu ‚Äî more vomiting, more cleaning up, and a little more chaos inside the car. We stopped again, gave him medicine, and took a long pause before getting back on the road.<br/><br/>For the rest of the day, we stayed cautious ‚Äî no solid food, just fluids and light snacks to keep everyone hydrated. The winding roads, the fatigue, and the worry made it one of our toughest travel days.<br/><br/>Finally, around 7:30 pm, we reached our Airbnb in Rakkar near Dharamshala ‚Äî a peaceful little home that felt like a blessing after the day we‚Äôd had. It had everything we needed at that moment ‚Äî hot water, a washing machine, clean beds, and quiet. We washed off the exhaustion, ran the laundry we‚Äôd been putting off, and finally sat down to breathe. There was a beautiful attic room with a perfect mattress and TV setup, we used a Netflix login to watch a good movie to relax oursleves. That night, as everyone drifted to sleep, we were simply grateful for rest, recovery, and a new day ahead."

excerpt: "A soulful 15-day road trip through Himachal‚Äôs diverse landscapes and charming villages, serene valleys, and misty mountains‚Äîeach turn revealing a quieter, more beautiful side of the Himalayas"

---

A 15-day road trip through Himachal Pradesh, winding through pine-scented forests, apple orchards, and snow-kissed mountains. From the bohemian charm of Kasol and the quiet orchards of Thanedar to the bustling lanes of Manali and the colonial echoes of Dalhousie, each stop brought its own flavor. We wandered through Tibetan monasteries in McLeodganj, soaked in the serenity of Jibhi, and breathed in the crisp air of Tirthan Valley. A journey of winding roads, cozy homestays, and endless chai breaks‚ÄîHimachal unfolded like a slow, soulful melody.

## Planning resources

We used a google sheet for our Trip planning and hotel booking tracking. This also helped us project the total cost of the trip. A public version of the sheet will be available for anyone to reference.
