    description: "We kicked off our adventure on a Friday, flying from Bengaluru to Delhi. The plan was simple: land in Delhi at night, stay overnight, pick up our rental car, and hit the road early the next morning. We left for the airport around 2:30 pm, carrying a fair bit of luggage, including a child seat to make the long road trip more comfortable for our younger one. Thankfully, IndiGo allowed it as an extra item without any hassle. The flight was smooth. We kept the kids fed and entertained, and landed in Delhi around 11:00 pm. Our hotel, however, was a disappointment. The listing had made it seem like it was in Aerocity, but it turned out to be in Mahipalpur, in a dingy part of town. Still, since it was just a night halt, we let it slide. We settled in, ordered some forgettable food, and got ready to call it a night. Meanwhile, I headed out to pick up our rental car from RBTS. We had originally booked a Hyundai Exter but were given a Suzuki Fronx instead, same segment and also automatic, so no complaints. Given the late hour, I appreciated that someone was available for the handover. The car was fairly new, with about 22,000 km on the odometer. Apart from a few minor quirks, everything looked good. The RBTS team was helpful when I had some questions. I got back to the hotel, and we all went to bed, ready to begin our road trip bright and early the next morning between 6–7 am"
    highlights:
      - "✅ Rains and pleasant weather"
      - "✅ Seamless car pickup with RBTS"
      - "❌ The first hotel for the night"
      - "❌ Carrying the car seat to Delhi"

      rating: 2
      review: "Misleading pictures and misrepresented location by saying that it is near airport. This is in Mahipalpur and not in Aerocity. Budget hotel and lack of hygiene in the bathrooms. Suspicious linen in the room. That being said the rooms themselves were decently large and we did not have to pay for the extra bed. Food, as expected, was bit underwhelming. Do not recommend"
    additional_considerations: "Even if you are looking to stay, look for a hotel in Aerocity and verify location"

    featured_image: "/assets/images/himachal/day3-main.jpg"
    description: "Our Day 3 began with a short drive from Kasauli to <b>Subathu</b>, a quiet little cantonment town just about an hour away. Subathu has quite a history—during the <b>Anglo-Nepalese War</b> in the early 1800s, it played a key role, and today it is home to the <b>1st and 4th Gorkha Rifles</b> of the Indian Army. We strolled around the cantonment, soaking in the calm streets and military vibe, before heading back to Kasauli. </br></br> Back in town, we stopped by the <b>Church of England</b> near Mall Road, a reminder of the colonial past tucked into the hills. For lunch, we switched gears and tried something unexpected—a Korean restaurant! The bibimbap was colourful, authentic, and surprisingly comforting, a nice change from the usual hill food. </br></br> By early evening, it was time for our much-awaited walk along the <b>Gilbert Trail</b>. This narrow 2 km stretch winds along the hillside and is known for its lovely views. True to its reputation, the trail rewarded us with a spectacular <b>sunset over the valleys</b>, the kind you pause to remember. As the light faded, we traced our steps back, reading the names of martyrs on the memorial boards along the cantonment road—a quiet, reflective end to the walk. </br> </br> Dinner was a simple affair that night, as our tired legs were eager for rest. We tucked ourselves in, ready to recharge for the adventures waiting on Day 4"

    additional_considerations: "Subathu is best explored on foot, so keep it light and short if travelling with kids. Gilbert Trail isn’t stroller-friendly—it’s narrow and uneven, so younger kids will need a handholding walk. Carry a light jacket and a torch for the trail if you plan to stay till sunset—the path gets dark quickly once the sun dips."

excerpt: "A soulful 15-day road trip through Himachal’s diverse landscapes and charming villages, serene valleys, and misty mountains—each turn revealing a quieter, more beautiful side of the Himalayas"

---

A 15-day road trip through Himachal Pradesh, winding through pine-scented forests, apple orchards, and snow-kissed mountains. From the bohemian charm of Kasol and the quiet orchards of Thanedar to the bustling lanes of Manali and the colonial echoes of Dalhousie, each stop brought its own flavor. We wandered through Tibetan monasteries in McLeodganj, soaked in the serenity of Jibhi, and breathed in the crisp air of Tirthan Valley. A journey of winding roads, cozy homestays, and endless chai breaks—Himachal unfolded like a slow, soulful melody.

## Planning resources
