summary: "A 15-day road trip through Himachal Pradesh, winding through pine-scented forests, apple orchards, and snow-kissed mountains. From the bohemian charm of Kasol and the quiet orchards of Thanedar to the bustling lanes of Manali and the colonial echoes of Dalhousie, each stop brought its own flavor. We wandered through Tibetan monasteries in McLeodganj, soaked in the serenity of Jibhi, and breathed in the crisp air of Tirthan Valley. A journey of winding roads, cozy homestays, and endless chai breaks—Himachal unfolded like a slow, soulful melody"

    description: "We kicked off our adventure on a Friday, flying from Bengaluru to Delhi. The plan was simple: land in Delhi at night, stay overnight, pick up our rental car, and hit the road early the next morning. We left for the airport around 2:30 pm, carrying a fair bit of luggage, including a child seat to make the long road trip more comfortable for our younger one. Thankfully, IndiGo allowed it as an extra item without any hassle. The flight was smooth. We kept the kids fed and entertained, and landed in Delhi around 11:00 pm. Our hotel, however, was a disappointment. The listing had made it seem like it was in Aerocity, but it turned out to be in Mahipalpur, in a dingy part of town. Still, since it was just a night halt, we let it slide. We settled in, ordered some forgettable food, and got ready to call it a night. Meanwhile, I headed out to pick up our rental car from RBTS. We had originally booked a Hyundai Exter but were given a Suzuki Fronx instead, same segment and also automatic, so no complaints. Given the late hour, I appreciated that someone was available for the handover. The car was fairly new, with about 22,000 km on the odometer. Apart from a few minor quirks, everything looked good. The RBTS team was helpful when I had some questions. I got back to the hotel, and we all went to bed, ready to begin our road trip bright and early the next morning between 6–7 am"

      rating: 2
      review: "Misleading pictures and misrepresented location by saying that it is near airport. This is in Mahipalpur and not in Aerocity. Budget hotel and lack of hygiene in the bathrooms. Suspicious linen in the room. That being said the rooms themselves were decently large and we did not have to pay for the extra bed. Food, as expected, was bit underwhelming. Do not recommend"
    additional_considerations: "Even if you are looking to stay, look for a hotel in Aerocity and verify location"
