summary: "A 15-day road trip through Himachal Pradesh, winding through pine-scented forests, apple orchards, and snow-kissed mountains. From the bohemian charm of Kasol and the quiet orchards of Thanedar to the bustling lanes of Manali and the colonial echoes of Dalhousie, each stop brought its own flavor. We wandered through Tibetan monasteries in McLeodganj, soaked in the serenity of Jibhi, and breathed in the crisp air of Tirthan Valley. A journey of winding roads, cozy homestays, and endless chai breaksâ€”Himachal unfolded like a slow, soulful melody"
