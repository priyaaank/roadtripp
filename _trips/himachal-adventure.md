    title: "Hopping over to the North India - Bengaluru to New Delhi"
    date: "3 May 2024"

    description: "We kicked off our adventure on a Friday, flying from Bengaluru to Delhi. The plan was simple: land in Delhi at night, stay overnight, pick up our rental car, and hit the road early the next morning. We left for the airport around 2:30 pm, carrying a fair bit of luggage, including a child seat to make the long road trip more comfortable for our younger one. Thankfully, IndiGo allowed it as an extra item without any hassle. The flight was smooth. We kept the kids fed and entertained, and landed in Delhi around 11:00 pm. Our hotel, however, was a disappointment. The listing had made it seem like it was in Aerocity, but it turned out to be in Mahipalpur, in a dingy part of town. Still, since it was just a night halt, we let it slide. We settled in, ordered some forgettable food, and got ready to call it a night. Meanwhile, I headed out to pick up our rental car from RBTS. We had originally booked a Hyundai Exter but were given a Suzuki Fronx instead, same segment and also automatic, so no complaints. Given the late hour, I appreciated that someone was available for the handover. The car was fairly new, with about 22,000 km on the odometer. Apart from a few minor quirks, everything looked good. The RBTS team was helpful when I had some questions. I got back to the hotel, and we all went to bed, ready to begin our road trip bright and early the next morning between 6–7 am"
    highlights:
      - "✅ Rains and pleasant weather"
      - "✅ Seamless car pickup with RBTS"
      - "❌ The first hotel for the night"
      - "❌ Carrying the car seat to Delhi"

      rating: 2
      review: "Misleading pictures and misrepresented location by saying that it is near airport. This is in Mahipalpur and not in Aerocity. Budget hotel and lack of hygiene in the bathrooms. Suspicious linen in the room. That being said the rooms themselves were decently large and we did not have to pay for the extra bed. Food, as expected, was bit underwhelming. Do not recommend"
    additional_considerations: "Even if you are looking to stay, look for a hotel in Aerocity and verify location"

    date: "5 May 2024"
    featured_image: "/assets/images/himachal/day3-main.jpg"
    description: "Our Day 3 began with a short drive from Kasauli to <b>Subathu</b>, a quiet little cantonment town just about an hour away. Subathu has quite a history—during the <b>Anglo-Nepalese War</b> in the early 1800s, it played a key role, and today it is home to the <b>1st and 4th Gorkha Rifles</b> of the Indian Army. We strolled around the cantonment, soaking in the calm streets and military vibe, before heading back to Kasauli. </br></br> Back in town, we stopped by the <b>Church of England</b> near Mall Road, a reminder of the colonial past tucked into the hills. For lunch, we switched gears and tried something unexpected—a Korean restaurant! The bibimbap was colourful, authentic, and surprisingly comforting, a nice change from the usual hill food. </br></br> By early evening, it was time for our much-awaited walk along the <b>Gilbert Trail</b>. This narrow 2 km stretch winds along the hillside and is known for its lovely views. True to its reputation, the trail rewarded us with a spectacular <b>sunset over the valleys</b>, the kind you pause to remember. As the light faded, we traced our steps back, reading the names of martyrs on the memorial boards along the cantonment road—a quiet, reflective end to the walk. </br> </br> Dinner was a simple affair that night, as our tired legs were eager for rest. We tucked ourselves in, ready to recharge for the adventures waiting on Day 4"

    additional_considerations: "Subathu is best explored on foot, so keep it light and short if travelling with kids. Gilbert Trail isn’t stroller-friendly—it’s narrow and uneven, so younger kids will need a handholding walk. Carry a light jacket and a torch for the trail if you plan to stay till sunset—the path gets dark quickly once the sun dips."
  - day: 4
    title: "Day 4: Yaks, Hidden Cafés & the Thrill of Hatu Peak"
    date: "6 May 2025"
    featured_image: "/assets/images/himachal/day4-main.jpg"
    description: "We started Day 4 on a relaxed note, leaving Kasauli around 10 am. The plan was simple—an easy 4–5 hour drive with a stop at Hatu Peak before reaching Thanedar. About two hours into the journey, we pulled over at a tea point where locals had brought along yaks for photos and colourful costumes for kids. Naturally, our little ones were excited to try both, and we happily joined in. It turned into an impromptu roadside photoshoot with tea in hand, against the backdrop of the scenic drive. The road through Shimla (<i>we have been to Shimla before and since we felt it was too commercial for us, it was not part of our itinerary</i>) and Kufri kept us entertained with its sweeping views. Just before Kufri, we made a quick photo stop before continuing on. For lunch, we stumbled upon a gem—Khadu Café near Nanni village in Matiana. With its rustic charm, local flavours, and freshly cooked food, this was easily one of the best food finds of our entire trip. The highlights? Sweet and savoury sattu, pahadi aloo, kadhi chawal, rajma chawal, and a soul-warming lemon-ginger-honey tea. Everything was authentic and bursting with flavour—we’d go back just for this! Post-lunch, we drove towards Hatu Peak. At the base, locals advised us to hire a driver for the narrow, steep climb with its deep gorges on either side. But we decided to take it on ourselves. They weren’t wrong—the single-lane mountain road was tricky and thrilling, with only one tight spot where another vehicle had to help us pass. Still, with some prior mountain driving experience, we managed fine and reached the top in about 45 minutes. The peak welcomed us with chilly winds, stunning views, and the serene Hatu Mata Temple. Just as we soaked it all in, the clouds rolled over and light rain began, adding to the magic. The descent took around an hour, and with a sense of accomplishment, we continued our drive. By 5 pm, we reached Banjara Resort in Thanedar, set amidst beautiful apple and orange orchards. The weather was cool, so sweaters and sweatshirts came out. The rooms were cozy with electric blankets—a small luxury that felt just right for the evening chill. After exploring the property and watching the sunset right from our room, we enjoyed a simple but fresh dinner at the resort’s restaurant. Tired yet content, we ended the day snuggled up in our warm beds."
    highlights:
      - "✅ Drive to and from Hatu Peak"
      - "✅ Food at Kadhu Cafe - Rajma Chawal, Kadi Chawal and Sattu"
      - "✅ Sunset at Banjara Orchards, Thanedar"
      - "❌ Traffic as we passed through Shimla, since we started late"

Worth for a stay for a day as a mid-stop for a longer journey. Alternatively, they may be able to arrange exploration and treks nearby if the goal is to stay longer and just relax in the lap of nature. They have an huge Orange Orchard to explore. Overall, value for money and great service. Highly recommended"

    additional_considerations: "The Hatu Peak drive is not for first-time mountain drivers. If you’re not confident, it’s better to hire a local driver for the climb. Carry warm clothes—the weather at the top and in Thanedar can get chilly, even in summer. The roads are good and drive is generally relaxing. You can plan a halt at Shimla if it makes sense for you"
