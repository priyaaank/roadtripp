    description: "We kicked off our Konkan journey a bit late, leaving Bengaluru around 11 am with one simple plan—reach Mangaluru by evening and crash. The road stretched close to 400 km and took us about 8 hours. Both of us took turns driving as we passed Channarayapatna, Hassan, Sakleshpur, and Bantwal. The stretch through Sakleshpur ghats was especially scenic—lush hills, winding curves, and a route that’s loved by road-trippers (and dreaded a little by truckers!). Nearing Mangaluru, the pace slowed with highway construction, but we still rolled into the city around 7 pm. Dinner at the hotel was forgettable—the buffet felt overpriced. But the property itself turned out better than expected. The rooms were bright, well-kept, and had a lovely view of an old building outside, almost like a reminder of a time gone by. Location-wise too, it was spot on, making it easy to step out and explore. For what we paid, it was actually good value for money. And step out we did—straight to Pabbas. If you’ve ever been to Mangaluru, you’ll know Pabbas isn’t just an ice cream parlor—it’s practically an institution. Their legendary “gudbud” ice cream, a tall glass layered with jelly, fruits, nuts, and scoops of ice cream, is said to have originated here. It was fun watching the kids dig in, eyes wide at the colorful mess of flavors. We wrapped up the night with some quick planning for the next two days in the city, before sinking into our comfy beds and calling it a day."

      review: "The hotel was well-located with bright rooms and a charming view, offering good value for money. The food, however, was average—the buffet didn’t feel worth the price"

        comment: "Pabbas is a Mangaluru classic—buzzing with energy and serving some of the most creative sundaes around. Their signature gudbud is a must-try, fun, colorful, and perfect for sharing with kids"
    additional_considerations: "If you start early from Bengaluru, you can reach Mangaluru in good time, with constructions over hopefully and even the day 1 can be used for a bit of sight seeing, if planned properly"

Our 10-day road trip along the Konkan coast took us from Mangaluru and Udupi to Padubidri, Gokarna, and finally all the way to Goa. The drive was full of moments where rivers quietly met the Arabian Sea, opening up to calm and endless views of the water. We found some of the cleanest and most untouched beaches in the country, dipped our feet in the sea whenever we got the chance, and happily indulged in local food and fresh seafood all through the journey
