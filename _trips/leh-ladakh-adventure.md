    description: "We hit the road at 4:45 AM, and it helped us beat the Bangalore traffic. Our playlist kicked in, and with the click of a seatbelt, the journey had begun. Our first pit stop came a few hours later at A2B in Sira. The breakfast was functional, not memorable—but it filled our bellies and bought us time to stretch our legs before hitting the road again. By mid-morning, we reached Dharwad, where a quick stop at Big Mishra. Their famous pedas were a delight. We grabbed some snacks too, but honestly, the pedas stole the spotlight. Between Belgavi and Satara, we were greeted with heavy traffic, never-ending construction, and surprise diversions that made the route feel more like an obstacle course. A gentle drizzle added to the chaos, but the scenery—and the promise of dinner—kept us going. By the time the sun dipped, hunger struck again. We stopped at Manas Restobar, just before Satara. The mutton thali was hearty and unforgettable, and the paya soup was great. The final stretch into Pune tested our patience. Twenty-five kilometers in two hours! We reached our hotel much later than planned, but when we hit the bed we were brimming with excitement as all our planning for the last few months was going to be real. The adventure had officially begun!"

    additional_considerations: "Start early (4:00 - 5:00 AM) to avoid heavy traffic on major highways. Carry cash for toll booths as some don't accept cards. Check weather conditions especially during monsoon season and keep emergency contact numbers handy for roadside assistance.

    description: "We started the day in Pune after a much-needed night’s rest. The weather was cool and overcast—perfect for a slow morning. After breakfast at our hotel, we took a short drive around some older parts of the city reminiscing about our time in the city. It was mostly about soaking in the quiet before before meeting extended family in the city. Before leaving town, we stopped for a quick car wash in Hinjewadi and costed us only INR 250. After the long drive from Bangalore the previous day, the car needed a refresh. The drive from Pune to Mumbai was mostly straightforward, except for the expected traffic snarl at the toll plazas. One of them took nearly 45 minutes to cross, which slowed us down quite a bit. As we approached Mumbai, pre-monsoon rain kicked in. Visibility dropped a bit, and traffic got heavier, especially around the outskirts. The roads were manageable, but progress was slow. By early evening, we reached our stop. The plan was to do a 2 day halt in the city and spend time with family. Dinner was simple and homemade, and everyone was tired from the day. We unpacked, got the kids settled, and wrapped up the day quietly. It wasn’t a very long driving day, but it had its share of delays and transitions"

    description: "Not every day on a road trip needs to be packed with a planned itinerary. We spent two slow, quiet days in Mumbai, tucked away in the comfort of a relative’s home while the city braced for a rain red alert. The monsoon had arrived early, and Mumbai was being Mumbai in rains. For us, not used to Mumbai’s electric mood swings, it was a little unnerving. Even the kids, who started off thrilled by the stormy soundtrack, ended anxious at the loudest cracks of thunder. But inside the house, things were warm and grounding. Lego sets, catch up with family, laughter and chai. Outside, the streets turned into rivers. Thankfully our plan included a brief stay with family in Mumbai and that planned break provided needed buffer with weather uncertainity in Mumbai"

    description: "We kicked off Day 5 before the sun had risen, with sleepy eyes, packed bags, and wheels already rolling. Mumbai, soaked from pre-monsoon showers, faded behind us soon. Our first stop came around 7 AM at Vasai, where a much-needed tea break turned into a two-hour pause. Blame it on the kids, or promised time to family, but it was a good break. By 9 AM, we were back on the road. The route was a full tour of Gujarat’s highways. Vasai → Vapi → Surat → Bharuch → Vadodara → Ahmedabad. The stretch till Vadodara was a trucker’s paradise and a driver’s patience test—slow convoys, endless honking, and the kind of traffic that makes you question all your life decisions. Finally near Bharuch we took a sharp turn for the better—switching from NH48 to NE4. The road opened up in front of us: smooth tarmac, wide lanes, and a 120 km/h speed limit. The expressway cut our drive time significantly and gave us a chance to breathe, cruise, and enjoy the changing scenery. After Vadodara, we merged back onto NH48/NE1. It wasn’t an expressway, but with lighter traffic, it was a pleasant, unhurried drive. As we entered Ahmedabad, we were stopped by cops to check if we were bringing in liquor into Gujrat (it being a dry state). Along the way our food excursions involved: Hotel Ahura (Talasari) - Famous for Irani fare, we kept it simple with chai and maska bun. The toilets? Functional, but not winning any awards. Jalaram Kathiyawad Hotel (after Kamrej) - A bit dark and modest-looking at first glance, but the Gujarati thali was fresh, flavorful, and soul-satisfying. Toilets? Just okay, but usable. By 6:30 PM, we finally rolled into Ahmedabad—tired, dusty, and entirely satisfied. This leg of our journey was all about contrasts: Truck traffic to smooth expressways. Quick tea to hearty thalis. And the joy of watching landscapes shift from coastal humidity to Gujarat’s dry plains—one toll gate at a time and intense heat. But we had reached our destination and kids didn't skip a beat before pluging into the pool. Despite the long drive, we ventured out for Dinner at Swati Snacks and we didn't regret it. Ordered a bunch of local delicacies from the menu and none of them were a decision we regretted. We topped that up with roadside Asharfi Kulfi and it was a fantastic decision as well. Finally, tired and bellies full, we crashed back into our beds and thus came our day to an end"

    date: "29 May 2025"
    featured_image: "/assets/images/leh/day6-gordhanthal-main.jpg"
    description: "We woke up to a classic Ahmedabad morning—blazing, bold, and nearly 40°C! And in that kind of heat, there’s really only one way to start your day: dive into the pool. From 9:30 to 10:30 AM, the kids splashed with glee, the grown-ups floated in peace, and the sun beamed down like a giant heat lamp. It was the perfect cooldown before the day began. Breakfast followed, though it didn’t win any awards. Let’s just say the French toast came with a side of too raw and left us wishing the chef had hit the “cook” button one more time. But hey—travel food has its quirks, and this was one of them. By noon, the sun had officially declared war. Stepping outside felt like entering a giant hairdryer set to max. So we ducked into the best kind of hideout: a cool, dark movie theatre. We watched Lilo & Stitch, a beautiful story about a Hawaiian girl and the alien-turned-family she accidentally adopts. It hit all the right notes for a family on the road—found-family, chaos, and love. The kids were glued, and truth be told, so were we. As the sun finally gave the city some breathing room, we stepped out again in the evening to explore the Atal Bridge and the Flower Garden. We entered through Gate 3, with multilevel parking right across, which made things refreshingly easy. The gardens were a riot of color, and the Atal Bridge glowed against the fading light. With the Sabarmati River flowing below and a cool breeze finally showing up, the outing felt like a reward for enduring the day’s heat. Dinner was the grand finale. We went to Gordhan Thal, a traditional Gujarati thali place, and it absolutely delivered. Every dish was bursting with flavor and warmth. We left the table grinning, stuffed, and deeply satisfied. Back at the hotel, with full bellies and tired feet, we crashed into bed and drifted off almost instantly. Day 6 was hot, hearty, and full of little moments that made us fall just a bit more in love with this vibrant city."

    featured_image: "/assets/images/leh/day7-dhabalogy-main.jpg"
    description: "We woke up fresh and early, ready to leave Ahmedabad behind and roll into the next chapter of our journey. With the sun barely stretching, we packed up, hopped into the car, and began our drive toward Jaipur. About four hours in, stomachs began to growl, and we pulled into a quirky little place called Dhabalogy for lunch. The food hit all the right notes—delicious, flavorful, and just the break we needed. The interiors were surprisingly stylish for a roadside stop, though the bathrooms (especially the boys’ one) were a bit... unusual. Let’s call it character. After the meal, we got back into the car, ready to continue cruising—until the car threw a curveball. Low DEF warning. Then, another message: Engine will stop after 400 km. Cue panic. We immediately called the nearest service center, who gave us clear instructions: “Whatever you do, don’t switch off the engine.” Apparently, the DEF tank wasn’t actually empty—the sensor just couldn’t read it properly. So with hearts racing, we decided to keep moving and not take any chances. Our next stop was the service center in Jaipur, where we dropped off the car for diagnostics and repairs. From there, we hopped into a taxi and headed to our hotel—Fairfield by Marriott—a calm, welcoming space we were more than ready to collapse into. Once checked in, we grabbed a light dinner, breathed a sigh of relief, and called it a night. After a day of great food, open roads, and a surprise car drama, sleep came easily—the kind you only get after a day full of unexpected turns."

    description: "We woke up late—10 o’clock, to be precise—and it felt wonderful to ease into the day without alarms or plans chasing us. Our dear friends in Jaipur had cooked up a delicious local breakfast, and we spent the morning chatting, laughing, and filling our plates (and hearts). After a warm farewell, it was time to run a quick errand—picking up a car for the next leg of our journey. Once done, we returned to the room for a short rest. The Jaipur heat was real, and a little downtime was just what we needed. Later in the day, another set of friends whisked us off to explore the Pink City—the bustling heart of Jaipur and a paradise for anyone who loves street shopping. Lanes filled with colorful fabrics, shining bangles, traditional jootis, and the aroma of local snacks tempted us at every turn. As the sun dipped and the shops started shutting their doors, we hugged our friends goodbye and headed back to our hotel, hearts full and hands (maybe a little too) full of shopping bags. It was a day of food, friends, colors, and chaos—the kind that leaves you tired in the best possible way."

    description: "The day began bright and early as we woke up, freshened up, and headed down for a quick breakfast to fuel the journey ahead. With full tummies and excited hearts, we set off toward Chandigarh, ready for another stretch of highway stories. About 4 to 5 hours into the drive, we took a detour—because when family is nearby, you don’t just pass by! We spent a lovely few hours at a relative’s home, catching up over conversations, chai, and plenty of laughter. These unplanned pauses always seem to leave the warmest memories. By late afternoon, it was time to say our goodbyes and hit the road again. As evening rolled in, we reached Zirakpur, just on the edge of Chandigarh, and checked into Radisson—our cozy stop for the night. Dinner was a proper Punjabi affair at the iconic Pal Dhaba. We ordered two kinds of chicken (because one is never enough) along with fresh, hot rotis—flavorful, comforting, and just what we needed after a long day. For dessert, we headed to a nearby softy corner. The softies, though, didn’t quite live up to the hype—melty and a bit bland—but hey, not every bite on a road trip is a win! We returned to the hotel tired but happy, ready to rest and recharge for the next chapter of our adventure."

    description: "We kicked off the day early, setting out from Chandigarh around 7:10 AM, with the mountains calling and our spirits ready for the adventure ahead. After a few hours on the road, we took a much-needed break at a cozy roadside café called The Daig. Steaming chai and a chilled shake were the perfect pick-me-ups as we stretched our legs and breathed in the fresh mountain air. Not long after, the Beas River joined our journey—its turquoise waters flowing gracefully beside us, as if guiding the way. The road twisted and climbed through the foothills of Himachal, with the river dancing beside us like a quiet travel companion. We had hoped to cross the famous Rohtang Pass, but to our disappointment, passes for beyond Rohtang weren’t being issued that day. Instead, we took the Atal Tunnel—a 10 km engineering marvel that slices through the mountains. The moment we emerged from its shadowy tunnel walls, it felt like stepping into a different world. The air was cooler, crisper. The landscape had changed—pine trees, snow-capped peaks, and an instant drop in temperature wrapped us in that unmistakable Himalayan embrace. Somewhere along the Chenab River, we stopped to take in the scenery. The icy water begged to be touched, the silence begged to be heard. It was one of those rare moments where time slows down and lets you just be. Eventually, winding through narrow roads and mountain valleys, we arrived at Gemur Khar Banjara, a peaceful resort nestled between Keylong and Jispa. It was picture-perfect—tucked amidst hills, with river sounds in the background and crisp, pine-scented air all around. But the beauty of the place was dulled a little by two unsettling things. First, our daughter’s condition had worsened. The altitude seemed to have triggered gastroenteritis, and she was constantly nauseous, weak, and unable to eat. Second, as if on cue, the car flashed a warning: DEF Sub-System Error. The dreaded alert meant that if we drove another 400 km without resolving it, the car would refuse to start again. And with no phone network, no workshops, and a rough, high-altitude drive to Leh ahead of us the next day, we were faced with a decision: Turn back to Chandigarh, playing it safe but undoing a week’s journey? Or press ahead to Leh, hoping the car (and we) could make it without further trouble? Night fell with more questions than answers. Wrapped in warm quilts and silence, we stared at the ceiling, each of us carrying a pocket of anxiety. Would the car start in the morning? Would our daughter feel better? Could we really make it across some of the highest motorable roads in the world without help? Tomorrow, we’d have to decide. But for tonight, we rested—hoping morning would bring clarity, courage, and a little luck."

    date: "3 June 2025"

    description: "Morning in the mountains began with worry still lingering in the air. Our daughter hadn’t eaten dinner the night before and skipped breakfast too—her nausea from the altitude hadn’t eased, and she was pale and quiet. We were anxious, but something else had kept me up that night: the DEF system error on the car. Then a thought struck—both times that warning had come up, the car had been parked on an incline. With the DEF tank only about 60% full, maybe the sensor hadn’t been fully dipped. So I’d turned the car around and parked it facing uphill. When we started the engine in the morning… no DEF error. It felt like a small miracle. Though the general system warning light still glowed, we had no new errors. The service center had warned us not to switch off the car once it was running—it might not start again. So we made our decision: We’d drive straight to Leh. No stops. No switching off the ignition. Just one determined run across 350 km of the Himalayas. We rolled out around 7 AM, slightly behind schedule but with nerves of steel. As we climbed out of Jispa, the landscape transformed like a scene from a storybook. Fresh snow lined the roads, a soft white layer on either side, glistening in the morning light. We drove cautiously, watching for hidden ice and flowing streams—meltwater from last night’s snow. Each crossing was a mix of nerves and thrill, and though we never had to engage the 4x4, knowing it was there gave us confidence. The drive was otherworldly. Hills turned to snow-draped ridges Snow gave way to canyon-like cliffs Cliffs became gravel-strewn slopes, then hard stone passes Finally, we rolled across Martian-looking flats between mountains—vast, surreal, and silent We stopped only twice—for water and a comfort break—and each time, the altitude hit hard. Short breaths, dizziness, and pounding heads reminded us we were above 15,000 feet. The kids were pale and limp, drained of energy, and even we struggled to stay sharp. Still, we pushed forward—taking turns at the wheel, managing the road and the little ones in the backseat. Just before Leh, at Tanglang La, the highest point of the drive, we felt hopeful. The DEF error had vanished completely. But then—another twist. *Service Transmission Error*. The car was stuck in 4th gear, refusing to shift. I didn’t panic. I just adjusted—kept my speed steady at 35–40 km/h, and drove with one goal: get us to Leh, no matter what. Later, we’d learn this was “Limp Home Mode”, a safety feature that kicks in when the transmission overheats—common in thin air and steep climbs, where the cooling system can’t keep up. We crawled through the final 80 km, taking two long, tense hours. And then… we saw Leh. We reached our hotel by 5 PM, shut the engine down (finally!), and just sat in silence, breathing deeply. The drive was done. We had made it—against all odds. We ended the day with khichdi and hot soup, the simplest and most comforting meal we could imagine. Tired beyond words, a little shaken but immensely relieved, we sank into bed. That night, there were no alarms, no alerts, no more decisions. Just sleep. A wild, unforgettable chapter had closed. We were in Leh."
    highlights:
      - "✅ The Drive from Jispa to Leh passed through 6-7 types of terrains and was breathtaking" 
      - "✅ The mountains and the hillsides were covered in fresh snow"
      - "✅ There was no traffic, but had enough cars and bikes through the way"
      - "❌ While we didn't need it, there aren't enough food joints on the way. Stock up water"
      - "❌ Road patch Sarchi from Pang was really bad. Around 80-100 kms"
      - "❌ AMS started to show its effect as we crossed passes. Kids were reeling with headache and nausea" 
      - "❌ Everyone not feeling well through the journey added to the distress"
      - "❌ Car errors with DEF error, transmission error and low tyre pressures"

    featured_image: "/assets/images/leh/day12-view-main.jpg"
    description: "After the intense drive and high-altitude drama of the past few days, we had intentionally kept our first day in Leh slow and restful. The goal was simple: recover, breathe, and let the body catch up with the mountains. We began with an early breakfast, but no rushing out the door today. Everyone was still recovering—nursing headaches, fighting fatigue, and just learning to be still again. We were told that Sea Buckthorn juice was great for altitude recovery, so we stocked up and started sipping. While the rest of the crew stayed cozy at the hotel, I stepped out to check on our car. After all the error warnings and gear trouble, I was half-expecting more surprises. But to my relief, every system had reset to normal. No alerts, no flashing lights—just peace under the hood. We also found a laundry service and dropped off our growing mountain of dusty clothes. The car got its own spa treatment too—a much-needed internal and external wash after its heroic climb through snow, mud, and Martian landscapes. Later, when energy slowly returned, we strolled down to The Tibetan Kitchen, a cozy local restaurant where we tried some authentic Ladakhi and Tibetan dishes—light, hearty, and just what we needed. Our walk back took us through Leh Market, where the kids peeked into shops, and we all took in the colors, the crafts, and the easy rhythm of mountain town life. By 6:30 PM, with the golden light draping the hills, we decided on a short drive to Shanti Stupa. The winding road up offered postcard views of Leh nestled between rugged ridges, and the stillness at the top was the kind that makes you whisper, even when no one’s around. We wrapped up the day just as gently as it had begun—with khichdi, soup, and warm quilts calling us back. After everything we’d crossed to get here, Day 12 was a breath of still air—quiet, healing, and deeply grounding."
    highlights:
      - "✅ Fantastic local food at The Tibetan Kitchen" 
      - "✅ Economic laundry at The Dobhi ghat. 24 hour wash and fold cycle" 
      - "✅ Slow day, leisurely stroll and beautilful views" 
      - "✅ Many car washes around city. Done in INR 400"
      - "❌ Don’t blindly trust Google Maps! On our way back from the Stupa, it took us through some really narrow roads that clearly weren’t meant for cars."
      - "❌ Even if it’s cold outside, avoid setting the AC to a temperature higher than the outside just to feel warm and cozy in a hotel room — you might wake up with a lingering headache and a bit of nausea."

    description: "After two nights of proper rest and altitude adjustment, we woke up on Day 13 feeling fresh, energized, and ready to explore Leh in full swing. On the agenda: a day packed with patriotism, adventure, history, and a little shopping magic. We began with a visit to the Hall of Fame, a moving tribute to the Indian Army. The museum walked us through the challenges of the Kargil War, and the extreme conditions soldiers face while posted at places like Siachen, where temperatures drop to -40°C to -70°C and dangers like avalanches and crevasses are part of daily life. We read stories of sacrifice and bravery, and by the end, there was a deep sense of respect, emotion, and gratitude within each of us. It was a powerful, grounding experience that left its mark. Next up: Magnetic Hill. While the famous gravity-defying effect didn’t quite pan out for us (optical illusion or not!), we found our own thrill nearby—ATV rides through desert hills! Two adults and two kids paired up and tore through the terrain, laughing and holding on for dear joy. Easily one of the most fun and spontaneous moments of the trip. Driving further, we stumbled upon the confluence of the Zanskar and Indus rivers—a windy, beautiful spot where muddy and blue waters meet. We sat by the banks, slurped down some Maggi noodles, and soaked in the raw, open beauty of Ladakh. We passed the peaceful Guru Pathar Sahib Gurudwara on our way to Likir Monastery, one of the oldest in the region. Legend has it that two serpents once protected the monastery, and as we walked barefoot across the surprisingly warm stone floors, it felt like stepping into another time. A little stream ran beside the monastery, and the kids were mesmerized—tossing pebbles, watching the water ripple, and just being. Lunch en route was a bit of a miss—a basic  restaurant with a limited and overly spicy menu. We had hoped for a more local experience but took it in stride and focused on what the day still had to offer. After a short rest at the hotel, we headed out to the Leh Palace in the evening. The views were grand, and the palace itself, rising seven to eight stories high, gave us a glimpse into the regal past of this mountain kingdom. Inside, a modest art and photo gallery shared stories of the region's history. A minor run-in with a group of motorcyclists briefly disturbed our mood, but we shook it off and made our way to the local bazaar, where the evening lights flickered and the stalls began closing. We found parking easily at one of the designated tourist lots, and wandered through the market until we found a lovely Thangka shop, where we picked up gifts and souvenirs for friends and family. As we walked back to our car in the cool, quiet dark of Leh, shopping bags in hand and a full day behind us, the fatigue finally crept in. We had a simple dinner at the hotel, settled our bills, and began packing for the next day’s journey to Pangong Tso Lake. A day full of honor, laughter, discovery, and a touch of shopping delight—the perfect finale to our time in Leh city."

    description: "We began Day 14 with an early flurry of activity—intense packing, bags stacked high, and every inch of the car neatly filled. But the mood was calm. For the first time in days, the car was error-free, the skies were clear, and everyone was feeling relaxed and ready. Our destination for the day was Pangong Tso, and the only major challenge in our path was the Changla Pass. We left around 8:30–9:00 AM, winding through scenic roads that hugged the mountain curves. Up until the pass, we trailed behind a slow-moving army convoy, but once past, the road opened up and we were cruising solo through vast, breathtaking landscapes. Most travelers head to Nubra Valley before Pangong, allowing a more gradual altitude shift. But we had decided to flip the route—take the longer drive first, then circle back to Nubra. Though we had a few moments of light headaches, we were largely acclimatized, and the drive felt rewarding rather than taxing. As we descended from Changla, the terrain transformed yet again—rolling hills, rocky outcrops, and the occasional surprise: a meerkat darting across the road, or cows that looked suspiciously like small, woolly yaks. And then, suddenly, there it was. Pangong Tso. The lake appeared through the mountain folds like a secret unwrapping itself—shimmering in blues, teals, and emerald greens, with colors shifting from the shore to the depths. We reached our cabin by the lake, a smartly designed, cozy stay that instantly made us feel at home. For most of the afternoon, we were the only guests, and while that brought a kind of rare peace, it also felt a little eerie in its stillness. Eventually, a few other travelers arrived, and the place felt more alive. We spent time strolling by the lake’s edge. Though the weather was chilly, the sun was relentless, so we layered on sunscreen and nibbled on snacks we had carried along. The sunset came quickly, disappearing behind tall peaks in what felt like a blink—bright to twilight in just 20 minutes. Later, after dinner in the common hall, we returned to our cabin—a snug, airtight space with a large window and a skylight. We lay gazing at the stars, wrapped in silence, until one by one, we drifted off to sleep. The night turned icy, dipping to -4°C, and the lack of ventilation slowly crept up on us. We turned on the oxygen concentrator, and within minutes, the brewing headaches vanished. Around 3 AM, we peeked out the window again and found the sky ablaze with stars—so close, it felt like we could reach out and rearrange constellations. We regretted not stepping out to soak in that celestial show properly, but promised ourselves we’d make up for it in Nubra. Electricity at Pangong is limited, powered by a generator from 6 PM to midnight, but the natural light, fresh air, and minimalism of the place felt perfect. With battery backups for phones, warmth in our hearts, and starlight in our eyes, Pangong Tso gave us exactly what we’d been craving: peace, wonder, and a place to just be."

    description: "We started Day 15 on a relaxed note, expecting a relatively short drive. But as always, Ladakh had its own plans—and three routes to choose from. The first was via Leh, long but safe, looping back before heading to Nubra. That felt counterproductive. The second, a scenic route along the Shyok River via Tangtse, came with a fair warning: rough roads, landslide-prone stretches, but no high-altitude passes. It also offered the only fuel stop in the region. We picked this route, chasing adventure and beauty over convenience. And scenic it was. The Shyok River accompanied us like a silvery ribbon, weaving through the valley with sparkling waters and quiet strength. We stopped a few times to dip our feet in its icy shallows, savoring the stillness. But serenity met reality soon—landslide detours nudged us onto dry riverbeds and bumpy off-road paths, the terrain raw and thrilling in equal measure. Luckily, monsoons hadn’t hit yet, so the dry beds were still safe to navigate. What we’d thought would be a quick hop turned into a 5–6 hour journey. There weren’t any worthwhile food stops, so we pressed on, stomachs growling, eyes on the road. We finally reached our destination—Lchang Nang Retreat, a truly sustainable eco-property tucked away in a peaceful part of Nubra. With its own organic kitchen garden, breathtaking views of both the Trans-Himalayan and Karakoram ranges, and a restaurant that impressed from the first bite, it was well worth the wait. We devoured a fantastic lunch and let ourselves sink into comfort. The only tradeoff? Lchang Nang is a good 45-minute drive from Diskit and Hunder, making it slightly less convenient for daily outings. But we didn’t mind. Later in the evening, we drove to the Panamik hot springs, about an hour away. The landscape en route was uniquely stark and peaceful. After that, we stopped at Himalayan Desert Adventure Camp near Diskit to check out a 2 km zipline—which, though impressive in claim, didn’t quite wow us with either safety setup or scenic views. At ₹2500, we skipped it. Instead, we returned to a tried and trusted thrill—ATV rides! This time, with a different route and setup, it felt even more rewarding than our previous one. We rode across sand dunes, this time ₹1500 for an adult and child—a fair price for the sheer joy of it. Back at our retreat, we strolled through the peaceful property, soaked in the mountain air, and ended the day with another unforgettable dinner. As the lights dimmed, the sky overhead deepened into a velvet dome, and we set our alarm for 2:00 AM—star-gazing time. And what a reward that was. The night sky came alive in a way we had never seen before. Stars, constellations, galaxies, all bright and impossibly close. We stared in awe through our cabin skylight, letting the silence and starlight wash over us. It was a quiet, humbling reminder of how easy it is to forget the vastness above in our screen-filled daily lives. That night, with tired limbs, full hearts, and star-dusted memories, we drifted into one of the deepest sleeps of our journey so far."

    description: "With a two-day stay planned in Nubra, we reserved Day 16 for soaking in the unique wonders this valley holds—from ancient monasteries to rolling sand dunes, and of course, the iconic double-humped Bactrian camels. We had debated making a trip to Turtuk, the last accessible village near the India-Pakistan border. While the idea of Balti cuisine and glimpsing across the Line of Control sounded tempting, the three-hour drive each way for just a view felt a bit too demanding for this stage of the journey. So, we chose rest over rush. The morning was slow and peaceful. We lazed around the eco-friendly comforts of Lchang Nang Retreat, letting the mountain stillness and crisp air do their work. By lunchtime, we finally stepped out to explore. Our first stop was the Diskit Monastery—the oldest and largest monastery in Nubra, dating back to the 14th century. We wandered through its ancient corridors and temples tucked into the cliffs, learning about Buddhist philosophy, Tara in her many colored forms, Maitreya (the future Buddha), and the Jataka tales illustrated on the temple walls—stories we had once read as children, now coming alive in mural form. Just nearby stood the 106-foot tall statue of Maitreya Buddha, watching over the valley in serene silence. The kids enjoyed spinning the rows of prayer wheels, while we soaked in the views and the quiet reverence of the place. Hunger struck soon after, and we made our way toward Hunder in search of lunch. We first stopped at a quaint riverside restaurant, but the complete emptiness made us wary of freshness, so we moved on. Eventually, we found a Kashmiri place with a decent crowd, which felt like a safer bet—and it turned out to be exactly what we needed. Bellies full, it was time for the dunes of Nubra. The camel ride area was loosely organized—a little chaotic, with people milling around—but the kids were thrilled to see the famous Bactrian camels, and we decided to let them go for a ride. While we’re usually conscious about animal ethics, this moment was for the children, and their joy was hard to deny. As they rode across the dunes, we watched the sun play with the sand—gold slipping between fingers, shadows stretching long across the desert. After the ride, we all climbed a few dunes together and even slid down a few, laughing like kids ourselves. The day closed with a spectacular sunset, painting the entire Nubra Valley in warm golds and amber—a magical farewell before the long road ahead. Back at the hotel, we settled in for an early dinner and an even earlier bedtime. The next day would be our longest drive yet—nearly 500 km to Srinagar, expected to take over 13 hours. We wanted to be up before sunrise, rested and ready. Nubra gave us space to slow down, learn, play, and breathe—a gentle pause before we hit the winding roads again."

    description: "Day 17 was going to be our longest drive, so we mentally geared up and started early at 6:30 am. The kids were still half-asleep when we packed up the car and began our journey to Srinagar. As expected, much of the drive was beautiful. We crossed Khardung La on our way to Leh, but the climb made our daughter feel nauseous, so we had to take more breaks than planned. The road from Nubra to Leh was a mix of smooth stretches and ongoing construction. We reached Leh between 10:30 and 11 am, right in the middle of city traffic. It took us almost an hour to get through and continue our journey. About three hours after leaving Leh, the barren desert gave way to lush, green hills and a gushing river. We reached Kargil around 3 pm and stopped at a roadside café called PitStop, just outside the town. It was next to an old, unused bridge and had a lovely view. After a quick tea break, we moved on. The road remained good until we hit the toll gate marking the start of Zojila Pass. From there, it got quite rough and took much longer than we expected. The Sonmarg tunnel came as a huge relief—it was both impressive and a major time-saver. As we approached Srinagar, we ran into a heavy traffic jam. A 40-50 km stretch was estimated to take 3 hours. Our planned arrival by 5:30–6 pm kept getting delayed. Eventually, Google Maps suggested a detour, which we followed. It had already turned dark, and we found ourselves driving through narrow village roads on the outskirts, which made us uneasy—especially given the recent unrest in the region. We were stopped by army personnel, who advised us to stick to the highways for safety, but let us proceed. After navigating more dark and winding roads—some of which felt like we were driving through a jungle—we finally reached our hotel at 9:30 pm. It had been a 15–16 hour drive, the longest of our trip. Exhausted and starving, we ordered dinner at the hotel. The food wasn’t great, but we didn’t mind. After long hot showers, we collapsed into bed. With three days in Srinagar left, we planned to take it easy the next day. We fell asleep almost instantly."

The day was dedicated to discovering the famous attractions of Kashmir's summer capital. We visited the stunning Pari Mahal, also known as the 'Palace of Fairies', which offered breathtaking panoramic views of Dal Lake and the surrounding mountains. It had a multi-level terraced garden. Not too far was Chashme Shahi. We also took a peaceful shikara ride on Dal Lake in eveving, gliding through the waters visited the lake bazaar on the lake. Other Shikaras selling food, souverniers were a bit too much. Only if there was a way to avoid them. The day included lunch at Adhoo's restaurant. We tried Trami, a traditional thali with mutton dishes. It was a fantastic set of dishes, could have been shared by 2 people but the restaurant won't allow. Finally ended the day with a bit of shopping on the main street for dry fruits and clothes. Don't recommend buying dry fruits like Walnuts and almonds unless you know someone, most shops were cheating with bad quality product. We later saw bad reviews all around where people were shown something and were given something else. This was especially true for Nishat dry fruits."

    description: "After taking a slow day to rest, we were ready for a short drive to Gulmarg. We left early to avoid traffic and long queues at the Gulmarg Gondola. The plan was to take the cable car to both Phase I and II and enjoy the views. We started around 7 am and managed to skip most of the city traffic. The drive took about 2–3 hours, and we reached Gulmarg by 9:30 am. It was not crowded, and many guides kept pestering us, even blocking the road near the parking area, falsely claiming that private cars weren’t allowed unless you hired a guide. We ignored them and walked directly to the Gondola station. Surprisingly, there were no queues, and we got tickets on the spot—a rare thing, as people usually line up from 5 am. We took the Gondola all the way to the top. The views were nice—blue skies, a chill in the air, and some snow—but honestly, after seeing Leh, it didn’t feel that special. We tried snow sledging, which turned out to be a bad decision. The snow was more slush than snow, and dragging the sled uphill was tough. It cost ₹1000 per person, and the ride down lasted just a few seconds. It was uncomfortable and not worth the effort—maybe better in peak winter, but definitely not now. As the place got more crowded, we enjoyed the views, had some overpriced Maggi, and rode the cable car back down. The best part of the whole visit was the Gondola ride itself. Next, we visited the Valley of Strawberries. After crossing a small stream—which was fun but a bit tricky—we found a shaded spot, sat down, and took in the views. We stayed for about an hour before deciding to head back to Srinagar for lunch. We went to a popular restaurant called Stream, right across from Dal Lake. The food was delicious and the setting felt authentic. We ate to our heart’s content and then took some rest. In the evening, we visited Nishat Garden. It was peaceful, full of greenery, birds chirping, and kids playing. After that, we did a bit of shopping nearby and treated ourselves to dessert at Ahdoos, followed by a stroll through the Residency Road market. That wrapped up our Day 19—with a mix of sightseeing, local experiences, and some great food. We returned to the hotel and quickly drifted off to sleep."

      review: "Located in city center so close to most places. Just a stand alone building with decent rooms. Restaurants was not great, neither was restaurant service. It felt like there was severe cost cutting. Overall decent for a short business stay, won't recommend for vacation. Charged 3000 INR per day for extra matress. Discounted it for 2 days when we complained about it being 60% of the room cost itself. Would have given it 3 stars but due to exorbitant pricing for extra matress not at all value for money for us"

    description: "This was our last day in Srinagar before we began our drive back to Chandigarh. In the morning, our daughter wasn’t feeling well—we suspected it was due to dehydration or a weak stomach. After some discussion, we decided to go ahead with a short visit to Sonmarg, keeping in mind whether the kids were up for the trek to Thajiwas Glacier. We talked it over with them and agreed that they could take horses while the two of us would walk. The drive to Sonmarg took about 2–3 hours. After passing through the Sonmarg tunnel, we stopped just beyond the exit. Following a chat with the security staff, we took a narrow path that led down from the tunnel exit and did a bit of off-roading. We parked near the river, dipped our feet in the water, and enjoyed the crisp mountain air under the bright sun. After relaxing by the river for about an hour, we decided it was time for lunch. We searched for a good place to eat, but since it was off-season, most of the popular restaurants had limited food options, and the smaller ones seemed unreliable and overly spicy. With our daughter still feeling unwell, we played it safe and grabbed a quick, light meal. We had originally planned to do the glacier trek after lunch, but her condition worsened, and we felt it was best to head back to Srinagar to rest, especially with a long drive ahead the next day. We returned to the hotel and spent the rest of the afternoon relaxing in the room. In the evening, we stepped out for one last dinner at Ahdoos and ordered à la carte. As always, the food was excellent. We took a short walk around the market afterward and then began packing for the journey ahead. And just like that, our time in Srinagar came to an end."

    additional_considerations: "Plan for lunch ahead of time in Sonmarg, we didn't find good options. We heard that all the horse rides go up and down Thajiwas glaciar the same route, however thre is a longer walking trek that is more scenic for the way back. We suggest exploring that if you go up on foot."

    title: "The Final Stretch: Srinagar to Chandigarh - A Long Drive Home"
    date: "13 June 2025"

    description: "Day 21 was our last long drive—from Srinagar to Chandigarh. We started early at 7 am, expecting a relatively smooth journey. For most of the route, we followed NH44, except for a stretch between Udhampur and Chak Dayala. That part of the road wasn’t in great shape, with varying surface quality, but Google Maps suggested it as it shortened the distance compared to the longer route via Jammu. Up to Udhampur, the road was under heavy construction and quite rough. Luckily, we avoided a two-hour traffic jam by skipping the bypass and driving through a nearby town. Along NH44, we passed several long tunnels, some as long as 6–7 kilometers. We were impressed by the scale of construction and the engineering efforts to carve through the mountains. At the same time, it was a little disheartening to see the ecological disruption caused by such development. After Phagwara, we left NH44 and spent the last hour and a half on state roads, dealing with traffic jams and diversions. We reached Chandigarh around 7 pm. For lunch, we stopped at a Haldiram’s just after Sujanpur—it didn’t show up on Google Maps, which was surprising. The food was average and caused acidity for most of us. While it seemed like the better option at the time, it wasn’t good enough to recommend. The drive took nearly 12 hours and marked the end of our road trip. After reaching Chandigarh, we decided to grab a bite and explore the city’s street food before checking into the hotel — and honestly, it turned out to be the best decision! A quick Google search led us to Sector 34C, and as soon as we arrived, the tempting aroma from the food stalls made us feel hungry even though we weren’t (at least, that’s what we thought).We kicked things off with pani puri and tikki chaat from Ram Chaat Bhandar (Ambale Wale) — saying it didn’t disappoint would be a huge understatement. Next up was a cheesy delight from a local pizza stall, followed by a colourful ice gola from the same shop. We really wished we had a little more room to try the momos from Toshib, which looked super popular and was drawing quite a crowd. Finally, a refreshing lemon soda wrapped up our lip-smacking dinner, and with happy hearts and fuller stomachs, we headed to the hotel to call it a night. Unfortunately, our stay at Radisson didn’t go well. The air conditioning wasn’t working in peak summer, and the front desk staff showed little concern. No one came to check until 11 pm, and only after I went down and complained in person. Even then, they just increased the fan speed. We were too exhausted to push further, so we made do with the fan and went to sleep."

      review: "Poor service experience on this stay. AC was not working in peak summer and front desk was unempathetic. No one came to look at the issue until 11pm after actively complaining. Even then, they just increased fan speed. Too tired to complain further but disappointing end to our journey."
    additional_considerations: "Start early for NH44 and be prepared for bad traffic and bad roads till Chak Daraya. Haldiram is near Sujanpur however not a recommended place for food. There are other good options at this stop though."

    description: "Day 22 was the final day of our journey. We had a slow, relaxed start and had breakfast at the hotel, which was much better than our previous stay at the same place. We then dropped off our car with Agarwal Movers and Packers. It cost us around ₹30,000 to ship it from Chandigarh to Bangalore. While slightly more expensive than other options, we've had good experiences with them in the past. (And as I write this, I’m happy to share that the car reached Bangalore safely in about 11 days—exactly as promised). After that, we took a taxi to the airport with all our luggage. Chandigarh airport is quite small, so there wasn’t much to do. We had a quick bite in the lounge and boarded our flight. By 9:30 pm on June 14th, we were finally home. We cleaned up and went to bed—tired, content, and full of memories from an amazing trip. Over the next few days, we were still in a bit of a trip hangover, reminiscing about the fun we had and the constant planning and re-planning we’d grown used to. It was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience—and now, we wait for our next adventure."

Our incredible 22 days road trip was more than just a journey across cities. It was a voyage through India’s wildly changing moods. From the sun-baked highways of Bangalore, to the sticky monsoon rains of Mumbai, the dry heat of Ahmedabad, the golden dust of Jaipur, and the cool breeze of Chandigarh. Each stop brought its own weather, its own vibe. But nothing quite prepared us for what came next: the thinning air and winding climbs of Jispa, the snow-kissed peaks of Leh, the shimmering blues of Pangong Tso, the high deserts of Nubra, and finally, the lush, pine-framed beauty of Srinagar. With every turn of the road, we felt the altitude shift, the temperature dance, and our hearts race with both awe and breathlessness. It was a test of wheels, willpower, and wonder—and we wouldn't have it any other way.

## Planning resources

[Leh Trip - Planning Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fql6Rz5rNlmB9kRUjXZZ7X3h2O-5RzCZuob3NLgymto/edit?gid=639703312#gid=639703312)

We used a google sheet for our Trip planning and hotel booking tracking. This also helped us project the total cost of the trip. A public version of the sheet is available for anyone to reference. The hotel cost has been left empty, as everyone has their own preference and thought process to book it based on their need. 

## Driving route 

<img src="../../assets/images/route.jpg" alt="Description" style="width: 40%; margin: 1rem 0;">

## Ground rules for driving safely

**No driving beyond 8 pm preferably**: We planned our travel in a way where we could choose to start early in the morning but we almost never drove after 8 pm

**Predictable hotels for a good night rest**: We did not compromise on the quality of stay at hotels to ensure we always had a good night sleep and comfortable beds. Hotels where basics and hygiene were guranteed

**Always start driving after a shower**: No matter how cold, start the morning with a warm bath to keep mind and body fresh

**Hydrate, hydrate and hydrate**: We incentivised drinking water for kids and ensured we drank enough ourselves

**Driver switch and small breaks**: We left buffer for traffic snarls and did driver switch. Took enough breaks to enjoy the journey
