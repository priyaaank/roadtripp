    description: "We hit the road at 4:45 AM, just as the sky began to stretch and yawn. The air was cool, the streets quiet, and the car packed with everything we needed—and a few things we probably didn’t. The kids were bundled in, half-asleep and half-buzzing with excitement. Our playlist kicked in, and with the click of a seatbelt, the journey had begun. Our first pit stop came a few hours later at A2B in Sira. The breakfast was functional, not memorable—but it filled our bellies and bought us time to stretch our legs before hitting the road again. By mid-morning, we reached Dharwad, where a quick detour to Big Mishra made the whole detour worth it. Their famous pedas—soft, milky, melt-in-the-mouth—were a delight. We grabbed some snacks too, but honestly, the pedas stole the spotlight. The road ahead, though, wasn’t quite as sweet. Between Belgavi and Satara, we were greeted with heavy traffic, never-ending construction, and surprise diversions that made the route feel more like an obstacle course. A gentle drizzle added to the chaos, but the scenery—and the promise of dinner—kept us going. By the time the sun dipped, hunger struck again. We stopped at Manas Restobar, just before Satara, and this one—oh, this one was a gem. The mutton thali was hearty and unforgettable, and the paya soup was the kind that warms more than just your stomach—it warms your soul. The final stretch into Pune tested our patience. Twenty-five kilometers in two hours—a true test of endurance, snacks, and Spotify. But as the lights of Pune flickered into view, a quiet smile took over. This wasn’t just another city on the map. This was where it all began— The place we were married. The place we bought our first home. The city where Sara was born. And now, for the first time, we were back—not as two, but as four. Coming back to Pune felt like opening the first chapter of an old favorite book—familiar, comforting, and full of stories waiting to be relived. The adventure had officially begun."

    description: "We woke up in Pune to that kind of weather that instantly makes you want to wrap your hands around a cup of chai and hum an old Bollywood tune. After a restful night, the morning moved gently—a slow, comforting start filled with breakfast, banter, and a drive through old neighborhoods that still echoed with memories of another time. Before we hit the highway, we made a quick detour to a car wash—a reward for our car after the 14-hour marathon from Bangalore. The kids watched the giant spinning brushes with fascination, giggling as they described it as a _vehicle roller coaster_. Honestly, they weren’t wrong. With the car gleaming again, we visited some relatives in Pune—a quick round of hugs, snacks, and stories before it was time to roll again. These were short but heartwarming moments, the kind you tuck away in your travel memory box. The journey to Mumbai was as expected—toll booth chaos included. One toll plaza took nearly 45 minutes to cross, giving us plenty of time for snacks, singalongs, and sighs. But as we neared the city, Mumbai decided to welcome us in true filmy style: Pre-monsoon showers. Rain fell like poetry on the windshield, the smell of wet earth rising, and city lights blinking through the drizzle. Thunder rumbled, traffic thickened, and yet, there was a strange beauty to it all—Mumbai, loud and alive, even in the rain. By evening, we reached another relative’s home, our nest for the night. We left our soggy shoes at the door, tucked into hot food, and settled into the comforting familiarity of being surrounded by family. Day 2 ended the way all good road trip days should—with full bellies, tired smiles, and stories waiting to be told."

    description: "Not every day on a road trip needs to be packed with sights and miles. Sometimes, the journey gently taps the brakes—especially when the sky turns theatrical. We spent two slow, quiet days in Mumbai, tucked away in the comfort of a relative’s home while the city braced for a red alert. The monsoon had arrived in full drama—thunder like a rolling drumline, and lightning flickering across the sky like a celestial disco. For us, not used to Mumbai’s electric mood swings, it was as awe-inspiring as it was a little unnerving. Even the kids, who started off thrilled by the stormy soundtrack, ended up snuggling close during the loudest cracks of thunder. But inside the house, things were warm and grounding. Card games, old family stories, laughter echoing down the halls, and a whole lot of chai. Outside, the streets turned into rivers. Inside, we slowed down. It wasn’t the kind of adventure we had planned—but it was the kind we didn’t know we needed. A pause. A chance to just be—with no alarms, no timelines, and no to-do list beyond being together. In the end, Mumbai gifted us a different kind of memory—not with monuments or markets, but with monsoon skies, warm hugs, and time that flowed as slowly as the rain outside."

    date: "28 May 2025"

    description: "We kicked off Day 5 before the sun had even had a chance to stretch—5:40 AM, with sleepy eyes, packed bags, and wheels already in motion. Mumbai, soaked from pre-monsoon showers, faded behind us as we zipped through early morning roads, chasing dry skies and new landscapes. Our first stop came around 7 AM at Vasai, where a much-needed tea break turned into a two-hour pause. Blame it on the kids, wandering legs, and the slow magic of mornings on the road. By 9 AM, we were back in motion. The route was a full tour of Gujarat’s highways—Vasai → Vapi → Surat → Bharuch → Vadodara → Ahmedabad. Sounds glamorous? Not quite. The stretch till Vadodara was a trucker’s paradise and a driver’s patience test—slow convoys, endless honking, and the kind of traffic that makes you question all your life decisions. But just when we thought we’d be stuck in honk-land forever, we took a sharp turn for the better—switching from NH48 to NE4 near Bharuch. It felt like someone had pressed fast-forward: smooth tarmac, wide lanes, and a 120 km/h speed limit that made the kids giggle and call it “our race track” (don’t worry, no actual racing happened). The expressway cut our drive time significantly and gave us a chance to breathe, cruise, and enjoy the changing scenery. After Vadodara, we merged back onto NH48/NE1. It wasn’t an expressway, but with lighter traffic and open skies, it was a pleasant, unhurried drive. Our foodie moments deserve a little spotlight: Hotel Ahura (Talasari): Famous for Irani fare, we kept it simple with chai and maska bun—comfort food at its finest. The toilets? Functional, but not winning any awards. Jalaram Kathiyawad Hotel (after Kamrej): A bit dark and modest-looking at first glance, but the Gujarati thali was fresh, flavorful, and soul-satisfying. Toilets? Just okay, but usable. By 6:30 PM, we finally rolled into Ahmedabad—tired, dusty, and entirely satisfied. This leg of our journey was all about contrasts: Truck traffic to smooth expressways. Quick tea to hearty thalis. And the joy of watching landscapes shift from coastal humidity to Gujarat’s dry plains—one toll gate at a time."

    description: "We woke up to a classic Ahmedabad morning—blazing, bold, and nearly 40°C! And in that kind of heat, there’s really only one way to start your day: dive into the pool. From 9:30 to 10:30 AM, the kids splashed with glee, the grown-ups floated in peace, and the sun beamed down like a giant heat lamp. It was the perfect cooldown before the day began. Breakfast followed, though it didn’t win any awards. Let’s just say the French toast came with a side of too raw and left us wishing the chef had hit the “cook” button one more time. But hey—travel food has its quirks, and this was one of them. By noon, the sun had officially declared war. Stepping outside felt like entering a giant hairdryer set to max. So we ducked into the best kind of hideout: a cool, dark movie theatre. We watched Lilo & Stitch, a beautiful story about a Hawaiian girl and the alien-turned-family she accidentally adopts. It hit all the right notes for a family on the road—found-family, chaos, and love. The kids were glued, and truth be told, so were we. As the sun finally gave the city some breathing room, we stepped out again in the evening to explore the Atal Bridge and the Flower Garden. We entered through Gate 3, with multilevel parking right across, which made things refreshingly easy. The gardens were a riot of color, and the Atal Bridge glowed against the fading light. With the Sabarmati River flowing below and a cool breeze finally showing up, the outing felt like a reward for enduring the day’s heat. Dinner was the grand finale. We went to Gordhan Thal, a traditional Gujarati thali place, and it absolutely delivered. Every dish was bursting with flavor and warmth. We left the table grinning, stuffed, and deeply satisfied. Back at the hotel, with full bellies and tired feet, we crashed into bed and drifted off almost instantly. Day 6 was hot, hearty, and full of little moments that made us fall just a bit more in love with this vibrant city."

    description: "We woke up fresh and early, ready to leave Ahmedabad behind and roll into the next chapter of our journey. With the sun barely stretching, we packed up, hopped into the car, and began our drive toward Jaipur. About four hours in, stomachs began to growl, and we pulled into a quirky little place called Dhabalogy for lunch. The food hit all the right notes—delicious, flavorful, and just the break we needed. The interiors were surprisingly stylish for a roadside stop, though the bathrooms (especially the boys’ one) were a bit... unusual. Let’s call it character. After the meal, we got back into the car, ready to continue cruising—until the car threw a curveball. Low DEF warning. Then, another message: Engine will stop after 400 km. Cue panic. We immediately called the nearest service center, who gave us clear instructions: “Whatever you do, don’t switch off the engine.” Apparently, the DEF tank wasn’t actually empty—the sensor just couldn’t read it properly. So with hearts racing, we decided to keep moving and not take any chances. Our next stop was the service center in Jaipur, where we dropped off the car for diagnostics and repairs. From there, we hopped into a taxi and headed to our hotel—Fairfield by Marriott—a calm, welcoming space we were more than ready to collapse into. Once checked in, we grabbed a light dinner, breathed a sigh of relief, and called it a night. After a day of great food, open roads, and a surprise car drama, sleep came easily—the kind you only get after a day full of unexpected turns."

Our dear friends in Jaipur had cooked up a delicious local breakfast, and we spent the morning chatting, laughing, and filling our plates (and hearts). After a warm farewell, it was time to run a quick errand—picking up a car for the next leg of our journey. Once done, we returned to the room for a short rest. The Jaipur heat was real, and a little downtime was just what we needed. Later in the day, another set of friends whisked us off to explore the Pink City—the bustling heart of Jaipur and a paradise for anyone who loves street shopping. Lanes filled with colorful fabrics, shining bangles, traditional jootis, and the aroma of local snacks tempted us at every turn. As the sun dipped and the shops started shutting their doors, we hugged our friends goodbye and headed back to our hotel, hearts full and hands (maybe a little too) full of shopping bags. It was a day of food, friends, colors, and chaos—the kind that leaves you tired in the best possible way."

    description: "The day began bright and early as we woke up, freshened up, and headed down for a quick breakfast to fuel the journey ahead. With full tummies and excited hearts, we set off toward Chandigarh, ready for another stretch of highway stories. About 4 to 5 hours into the drive, we took a detour—because when family is nearby, you don’t just pass by! We spent a lovely few hours at a relative’s home, catching up over conversations, chai, and plenty of laughter. These unplanned pauses always seem to leave the warmest memories. By late afternoon, it was time to say our goodbyes and hit the road again. As evening rolled in, we reached Zirakpur, just on the edge of Chandigarh, and checked into Radisson—our cozy stop for the night. Dinner was a proper Punjabi affair at the iconic Pal Dhaba. We ordered two kinds of chicken (because one is never enough) along with fresh, hot rotis—flavorful, comforting, and just what we needed after a long day. For dessert, we headed to a nearby softy corner. The softies, though, didn’t quite live up to the hype—melty and a bit bland—but hey, not every bite on a road trip is a win! We returned to the hotel tired but happy, ready to rest and recharge for the next chapter of our adventure."

    title: "Chandigarh to Jispa - Into the Heart of the Himalayas – With a Worry Tucked In"
    date: "2 June 2025"
    featured_image: "/assets/images/day10-crossing-manali.jpg"
    description: "We kicked off the day early, setting out from Chandigarh around 7:10 AM, with the mountains calling and our spirits ready for the adventure ahead. After a few hours on the road, we took a much-needed break at a cozy roadside café called The Diaig. Steaming chai and a chilled shake were the perfect pick-me-ups as we stretched our legs and breathed in the fresh mountain air. Not long after, the Beas River joined our journey—its turquoise waters flowing gracefully beside us, as if guiding the way. The road twisted and climbed through the foothills of Himachal, with the river dancing beside us like a quiet travel companion. We had hoped to cross the famous Rohtang Pass, but to our disappointment, passes for beyond Rohtang weren’t being issued that day. Instead, we took the Atal Tunnel—a 10 km engineering marvel that slices through the mountains. The moment we emerged from its shadowy tunnel walls, it felt like stepping into a different world. The air was cooler, crisper. The landscape had changed—pine trees, snow-capped peaks, and an instant drop in temperature wrapped us in that unmistakable Himalayan embrace. Somewhere along the Chenab River, we stopped to take in the scenery. The icy water begged to be touched, the silence begged to be heard. It was one of those rare moments where time slows down and lets you just be. Eventually, winding through narrow roads and mountain valleys, we arrived at Gemur Khar Banjara, a peaceful resort nestled between Keylong and Jispa. It was picture-perfect—tucked amidst hills, with river sounds in the background and crisp, pine-scented air all around. But the beauty of the place was dulled a little by two unsettling things. First, our daughter’s condition had worsened. The altitude seemed to have triggered gastroenteritis, and she was constantly nauseous, weak, and unable to eat. Second, as if on cue, the car flashed a warning: DEF Sub-System Error. The dreaded alert meant that if we drove another 400 km without resolving it, the car would refuse to start again. And with no phone network, no workshops, and a rough, high-altitude drive to Leh ahead of us the next day, we were faced with a decision: Turn back to Chandigarh, playing it safe but undoing a week’s journey? Or press ahead to Leh, hoping the car (and we) could make it without further trouble? Night fell with more questions than answers. Wrapped in warm quilts and silence, we stared at the ceiling, each of us carrying a pocket of anxiety. Would the car start in the morning? Would our daughter feel better? Could we really make it across some of the highest motorable roads in the world without help? Tomorrow, we’d have to decide. But for tonight, we rested—hoping morning would bring clarity, courage, and a little luck."

    description: "Morning in the mountains began with worry still lingering in the air. Our daughter hadn’t eaten dinner the night before and skipped breakfast too—her nausea from the altitude hadn’t eased, and she was pale and quiet. We were anxious, but something else had kept me up that night: the DEF system error on the car. Then a thought struck—both times that warning had come up, the car had been parked on an incline. With the DEF tank only about 60% full, maybe the sensor hadn’t been fully dipped. So I’d turned the car around and parked it facing uphill. When we started the engine in the morning… no DEF error. It felt like a small miracle. Though the general system warning light still glowed, we had no new errors. The service center had warned us not to switch off the car once it was running—it might not start again. So we made our decision: We’d drive straight to Leh. No stops. No switching off the ignition. Just one determined run across 350 km of the Himalayas. We rolled out around 7 AM, slightly behind schedule but with nerves of steel. As we climbed out of Jispa, the landscape transformed like a scene from a storybook. Fresh snow lined the roads, a soft white layer on either side, glistening in the morning light. We drove cautiously, watching for hidden ice and flowing streams—meltwater from last night’s snow. Each crossing was a mix of nerves and thrill, and though we never had to engage the 4x4, knowing it was there gave us confidence. The drive was otherworldly. Hills turned to snow-draped ridges Snow gave way to canyon-like cliffs Cliffs became gravel-strewn slopes, then hard stone passes Finally, we rolled across Martian-looking flats between mountains—vast, surreal, and silent We stopped only twice—for water and a comfort break—and each time, the altitude hit hard. Short breaths, dizziness, and pounding heads reminded us we were above 15,000 feet. The kids were pale and limp, drained of energy, and even we struggled to stay sharp. Still, we pushed forward—taking turns at the wheel, managing the road and the little ones in the backseat. Just before Leh, at Tanglang La, the highest point of the drive, we felt hopeful. The DEF error had vanished completely. But then—another twist. *Service Transmission Error*. The car was stuck in 4th gear, refusing to shift. I didn’t panic. I just adjusted—kept my speed steady at 35–40 km/h, and drove with one goal: get us to Leh, no matter what. Later, we’d learn this was “Limp Home Mode”, a safety feature that kicks in when the transmission overheats—common in thin air and steep climbs, where the cooling system can’t keep up. We crawled through the final 80 km, taking two long, tense hours. And then… we saw Leh. We reached our hotel by 5 PM, shut the engine down (finally!), and just sat in silence, breathing deeply. The drive was done. We had made it—against all odds. We ended the day with khichdi and hot soup, the simplest and most comforting meal we could imagine. Tired beyond words, a little shaken but immensely relieved, we sank into bed. That night, there were no alarms, no alerts, no more decisions. Just sleep. A wild, unforgettable chapter had closed. We were in Leh."
    highlights:
      - "✅ The Drive from Jispa to Leh passed through 6-7 types of terrains and was breathtaking" 
      - "✅ The mountains and the hillsides were covered in fresh snow"
      - "✅ There was no traffic, but had enough cars and bikes through the way"
      - "❌ While we didn't need it, there aren't enough food joints on the way. Stock up water"
      - "❌ Road patch Sarchi from Pang was really bad. Around 80-100 kms"
      - "❌ AMS started to show its effect as we crossed passes. Kids were reeling with headache and nausea" 
      - "❌ Everyone not feeling well through the journey added to the distress"
      - "❌ Car errors with DEF error, transmission error and low tyre pressures"

    title: "Slow Steps in Leh – Rest, Recovery & Quiet Joys"
    date: "4 June 2025"
    featured_image: "/assets/images/day12-view-main.jpg"
    description: "After the intense drive and high-altitude drama of the past few days, we had intentionally kept our first day in Leh slow and restful. The goal was simple: recover, breathe, and let the body catch up with the mountains. We began with an early breakfast, but no rushing out the door today. Everyone was still recovering—nursing headaches, fighting fatigue, and just learning to be still again. We were told that Sea Buckthorn juice was great for altitude recovery, so we stocked up and started sipping. While the rest of the crew stayed cozy at the hotel, I stepped out to check on our car. After all the error warnings and gear trouble, I was half-expecting more surprises. But to my relief, every system had reset to normal. No alerts, no flashing lights—just peace under the hood. We also found a laundry service and dropped off our growing mountain of dusty clothes. The car got its own spa treatment too—a much-needed internal and external wash after its heroic climb through snow, mud, and Martian landscapes. Later, when energy slowly returned, we strolled down to The Tibetan Kitchen, a cozy local restaurant where we tried some authentic Ladakhi and Tibetan dishes—light, hearty, and just what we needed. Our walk back took us through Leh Market, where the kids peeked into shops, and we all took in the colors, the crafts, and the easy rhythm of mountain town life. By 6:30 PM, with the golden light draping the hills, we decided on a short drive to Shanti Stupa. The winding road up offered postcard views of Leh nestled between rugged ridges, and the stillness at the top was the kind that makes you whisper, even when no one’s around. We wrapped up the day just as gently as it had begun—with khichdi, soup, and warm quilts calling us back. After everything we’d crossed to get here, Day 12 was a breath of still air—quiet, healing, and deeply grounding."
    highlights:
      - "✅ Fantastic local food at The Tibetan Kitchen" 
      - "✅ Economic laundry at The Dobhi ghat. 24 hour wash and fold cycle" 
      - "✅ Slow day, leisurely stroll and beautilful views" 
      - "✅ Many car washes around city. Done in INR 400"

    description: "After two nights of proper rest and altitude adjustment, we woke up on Day 13 feeling fresh, energized, and ready to explore Leh in full swing. On the agenda: a day packed with patriotism, adventure, history, and a little shopping magic. We began with a visit to the Hall of Fame, a moving tribute to the Indian Army. The museum walked us through the challenges of the Kargil War, and the extreme conditions soldiers face while posted at places like Siachen, where temperatures drop to -40°C to -70°C and dangers like avalanches and crevasses are part of daily life. We read stories of sacrifice and bravery, and by the end, there was a deep sense of respect, emotion, and gratitude within each of us. It was a powerful, grounding experience that left its mark. Next up: Magnetic Hill. While the famous gravity-defying effect didn’t quite pan out for us (optical illusion or not!), we found our own thrill nearby—ATV rides through desert hills! Two adults and two kids paired up and tore through the terrain, laughing and holding on for dear joy. Easily one of the most fun and spontaneous moments of the trip. Driving further, we stumbled upon the confluence of the Zanskar and Indus rivers—a windy, beautiful spot where muddy and blue waters meet. We sat by the banks, slurped down some Maggi noodles, and soaked in the raw, open beauty of Ladakh. We passed the peaceful Guru Pathar Sahib Gurudwara on our way to Likir Monastery, one of the oldest in the region. Legend has it that two serpents once protected the monastery, and as we walked barefoot across the surprisingly warm stone floors, it felt like stepping into another time. A little stream ran beside the monastery, and the kids were mesmerized—tossing pebbles, watching the water ripple, and just being. Lunch en route was a bit of a miss—a basic army-run restaurant with a limited and overly spicy menu. We had hoped for a more local experience but took it in stride and focused on what the day still had to offer. After a short rest at the hotel, we headed out to the Leh Palace in the evening. The views were grand, and the palace itself, rising seven to eight stories high, gave us a glimpse into the regal past of this mountain kingdom. Inside, a modest art and photo gallery shared stories of the region's history. A minor run-in with a group of motorcyclists briefly disturbed our mood, but we shook it off and made our way to the local bazaar, where the evening lights flickered and the stalls began closing. We found parking easily at one of the designated tourist lots, and wandered through the market until we found a lovely Thangka shop, where we picked up gifts and souvenirs for friends and family. As we walked back to our car in the cool, quiet dark of Leh, shopping bags in hand and a full day behind us, the fatigue finally crept in. We had a simple dinner at the hotel, settled our bills, and began packing for the next day’s journey to Pangong Tso Lake. A day full of honor, laughter, discovery, and a touch of shopping delight—the perfect finale to our time in Leh city."

    description: "On our 14th day we started with intense packing. The drive ahead was not too long. We packed everything and stuffed it into the car. All car errors had gone away, everyone was in high spirits and the mood was relaxed. The only pass between us and PangongTso was Changla pass. WE started around 8:30-9:00 am. The drive, as imagined, was serene, navigating bending roads and going up the pass. Until the pass we trailed a army convoy. Post that we picked up pace and were pretty much by ourselves on the road. Typically people want to go to Nubra valley from Leh and then Pangong Tso, as it goes up in Altitude more gradually. However we decided that we will do a longer drive first and then come back to Nubra valley. So we moved through the pass as a slight head ache came and went. We were mostly acclamatized. The terrains and drive were changing and remained lovely. We spotted some Meerkats and Cows that looked like Yaks. Finally, close to Pangong Tso, the lake reared its head beyond the mountains and boy was it beautiful! It was all shades of blue and emeerld green moving through the shore to the center. We reached our cabin, which I have to say was very smartly done and was very comfortable. Unfortunately until much later in the evening, we were the only people around and it was peaceful but a bit eerie as well. Finally we saw some people showing up towards later in the evening. We spent time close to lake taking a stroll, however despite chilly climate, the Sun was unforgivingly harsh. We applied layers of Sunscreen and ate some delicacies that we were carrying. The evening sunset happened from glaring sun to almost dark in just 20-35 minutes as Sun went behind one of the high mountains. We stepped out and took a stroll, checked out the night sky and then post dinner in a common hall, settled in the cabin. It was air tight one with a large window and a skylight. We gazed until slowly everyone drifted off to sleep. The temperature in the night dipped as low as -4 degrees and we all could feel the chilly night as well as rising carbon di oxide in the cabin with no ventilation. Thats when we switched on the oxygen concentrator and the headache that was creeping in slowly disappeared. Meanwhile we peeped out of the window at 3 am and regretted later not going out and check the night sky and stars in their full bloom. We resolvedto do that in Nubra valley for sure. However even from Window, all constellations seemed so close. It was surreal. There is limited electricity at Pangong Tso, so you get it from evening 6pm to 12 am via generator but otherwise natural breeze, light is more than sufficient and there is battery backup to charge the phone. All in all it was a relaxed peaceful stay we all were craving next to the lake."

Our incredible 22 days road trip was more than just a journey across cities. It was a voyage through India’s wildly changing moods. From the sun-baked highways of Bangalore, to the sticky monsoon rains of Mumbai, the dry heat of Ahmedabad, the golden dust of Jaipur, and the cool breeze of Chandigarh. Each stop brought its own weather, its own vibe. But nothing quite prepared us for what came next: the thinning air and winding climbs of Jispa, the snow-kissed peaks of Leh, the shimmering blues of Pangong Tso, the high deserts of Nubra, and finally, the lush, pine-framed beauty of Srinagar. With every turn of the road, we felt the altitude shift, the temperature dance, and our hearts race with both awe and breathlessness. It was a test of wheels, willpower, and wonder—and we wouldn't have it any other way.

## Driving route 

<img src="../../assets/images/route.jpg" alt="Description" style="width: 40%; margin: 1rem 0;">

## Ground rules for driving safely

**No driving beyond 8 pm preferably**: We planned our travel in a way where we could choose to start early in the morning but we almost never drove after 8 pm

**Predictable hotels for a good night rest**: We did not compromise on the quality of stay at hotels to ensure we always had a good night sleep and comfortable beds. Hotels where basics and hygiene were guranteed

**Always start driving after a shower**: No matter how cold, start the morning with a warm bath to keep mind and body fresh

**Hydrate, hydrate and hydrate**: We incentivised drinking water for kids and ensured we drank enough ourselves

**Driver switch and small breaks**: We left buffer for traffic snarls and did driver switch. Took enough breaks to enjoy the journey
