    description: "We hit the road from Bangalore at the crack of dawn—4:45 AM sharp! The skies were gentle, the breeze cool, and our spirits high. Our car was packed, playlists were ready, and the kids were snuggled in, half asleep and half excited. Our first stop? Breakfast at A2B in Sira after a couple of hours on the highway. The food filled our tummies, but let’s just say it didn’t make it to the highlight reel. With more miles to go, we cruised ahead to Dharwad and dropped by Big Mishra, famous for its legendary pedas. And oh—those soft, sweet bites were worth every calorie! We grabbed a quick snack too, but again, it was the pedas that stole the show. As we approached Kolhapur, traffic slowed us down. Cones, diversions, and roadwork popped up like surprise guests all the way from Belgavi to Satara. It felt like a zigzag obstacle course with a sprinkle of rain to keep things interesting. Hunger struck again just before sunset, and we stopped at Manas Restobar near Satara. Now this was a win! The mutton thali was pure magic, and the paya soup was the kind that warms your soul and makes your eyes roll back in delight. The last stretch into Pune tested our patience—25 km took nearly two hours thanks to the evening traffic madness. But as we finally rolled into the city, a quiet smile spread across our faces. Pune wasn’t just a stop on the map—it was where our story began. We were married here. Bought our first home here. And little Sara was born here. For the first time, we were back—as a family of four. And that made arriving in Pune feel like coming home, with the adventure just beginning."

    description: "We woke up in Pune to the kind of weather that makes you want to sip chai and hum an old Bollywood tune. After a solid night’s rest, the day began slow and sweet—breakfast, banter, and a little drive around the old neighbourhoods that still held whispers of our past. Before hitting the highway, we made a quick pitstop at a car wash. After yesterday’s 14-hour drive, the car definitely deserved a bubble bath. The kids watched the giant brushes spin like a roller coaster ride for vehicles—it was oddly satisfying! Next, it was time for hugs and hellos as we met some relatives in Pune. Smiles, snacks, stories—short but sweet. By afternoon, we were back on the road, this time heading towards Mumbai. But of course, no road trip in India is complete without the infamous toll traffic. One particular toll plaza took 45 minutes to crawl through—cue the sighs, snacks, and singalongs inside the car. As we entered Mumbai, the skies put on a dramatic show. The city was soaking in pre-monsoon showers, and the rain came down like it had a story of its own. Windshield wipers danced, the smell of wet earth filled the air, and the city welcomed us with thunder, traffic, and twinkling lights. By evening, we reached another relative’s home—our cozy nest for the night. Wet shoes at the door, warm food on the table, and familiar faces all around. Day 2 wrapped up with tired smiles, rain-soaked clothes, and hearts full of warmth."

    description: "Not every day on a road trip has to be go-go-go. Sometimes, the journey pauses—especially when the sky decides to throw a full-blown drama show! We spent two quiet days in Mumbai, staying snug at a relative’s home while the city braced for a red alert. Thunder boomed like a drumroll in the sky, and lightning flashed like someone was flicking the world's biggest light switch on and off. For those of us not used to Mumbai’s wild monsoon mood swings, it was… intense. Even the kids went from wide-eyed excitement to holding onto us during the loudest crackles of thunder. But inside the house, it was warm and cozy. We played card games, told old family stories, and watched the rain turn streets into little rivers. The break gave us time to rest, recharge, and just be with each other—no rush, no alarms, just the rhythm of the rain. Sometimes, the most memorable parts of a trip aren’t the places you see, but the unexpected pauses that help you slow down and soak it all in. Mumbai gave us one such pause—with extra thunder for effect."

    description: "We kicked off Day 5 before the sun had fully stretched—5:40 AM, wheels rolling and sky still yawning. Leaving behind a rain-drenched Mumbai, we drove through sleepy roads and made our first tea break at Vasai around 7 AM. After a two-hour pause (because: kids, tea, and wandering legs), we were back on the road by 9. Our route for the day was a who’s who of Gujarat's roadways—Vasai, Vapi, Surat, Bharuch, Vadodara, and finally, Ahmedabad. Sounds exciting? Well… not all of it. The stretch till Vadodara was a truck-lover’s dream and a driver’s patience test. Heavy traffic, slow-moving convoys, and enough honking to make a city symphony. But just as we were wondering if this was our fate for the day, we switched from NH48 to NE4 near Bharuch—and oh, what a change! NE4 felt like someone hit the “fast-forward” button. Smooth roads, wide lanes, and a posted speed limit of 120 km/h—the kids called it our personal race track (minus the racing, of course). It sliced down our drive time and gave us a chance to breathe and enjoy the ride. We rejoined NH48/NE1 after Vadodara, which wasn’t an expressway but still gave us a pleasant, easy drive. The scenery opened up, traffic thinned, and the skies played nice. Our foodie breaks deserve a spotlight too. **Tea at Hotel Ahura (near Talasari)**: Famous for Irani food, we settled for chai and maska bun—a soft, buttery hug in bread form. Yum! Toilets? Usable, but could use some love. **Lunch at Jalaram Kathiyawad Hotel, just past Kamrej**, It looked a bit dim and uninviting, but don’t judge a thali by its lighting. The food was fresh, flavorful, and pure Gujarati goodness. Again, toilets were just okay, but functional. By 6:30 PM, after nearly 12 hours on the road, we rolled into Ahmedabad—tired, dusty, but satisfied. This leg of the journey was all about contrasts: slow trucks and zippy expressways, plain tea and rich thalis, and the joy of watching the landscape shift with every hour."

    date: "29 May 2025"

    description: "We woke up to a classic Ahmedabad morning—blazing, bold, and nearly 40°C! And in that kind of heat, there’s really only one way to start your day: dive into the pool. From 9:30 to 10:30 AM, the kids splashed with glee, the grown-ups floated in peace, and the sun beamed down like a giant heat lamp. It was the perfect cooldown before the day began. Breakfast followed, though it didn’t win any awards. Let’s just say the French toast came with a side of too raw and left us wishing the chef had hit the “cook” button one more time. But hey—travel food has its quirks, and this was one of them. By noon, the sun had officially declared war. Stepping outside felt like entering a giant hairdryer set to max. So we ducked into the best kind of hideout: a cool, dark movie theatre. We watched Lilo & Stitch, a beautiful story about a Hawaiian girl and the alien-turned-family she accidentally adopts. It hit all the right notes for a family on the road—found-family, chaos, and love. The kids were glued, and truth be told, so were we. As the sun finally gave the city some breathing room, we stepped out again in the evening to explore the Atal Bridge and the Flower Garden. We entered through Gate 3, with multilevel parking right across, which made things refreshingly easy. The gardens were a riot of color, and the Atal Bridge glowed against the fading light. With the Sabarmati River flowing below and a cool breeze finally showing up, the outing felt like a reward for enduring the day’s heat. Dinner was the grand finale. We went to Gordhan Thal, a traditional Gujarati thali place, and it absolutely delivered. Every dish was bursting with flavor and warmth. We left the table grinning, stuffed, and deeply satisfied. Back at the hotel, with full bellies and tired feet, we crashed into bed and drifted off almost instantly. Day 6 was hot, hearty, and full of little moments that made us fall just a bit more in love with this vibrant city."

    description: "We woke up fresh and early, ready to leave Ahmedabad behind and roll into the next chapter of our journey. With the sun barely stretching, we packed up, hopped into the car, and began our drive toward Jaipur. About four hours in, stomachs began to growl, and we pulled into a quirky little place called Dhabalogy for lunch. The food hit all the right notes—delicious, flavorful, and just the break we needed. The interiors were surprisingly stylish for a roadside stop, though the bathrooms (especially the boys’ one) were a bit... unusual. Let’s call it character. After the meal, we got back into the car, ready to continue cruising—until the car threw a curveball. Low DEF warning. Then, another message: Engine will stop after 400 km. Cue panic. We immediately called the nearest service center, who gave us clear instructions: “Whatever you do, don’t switch off the engine.” Apparently, the DEF tank wasn’t actually empty—the sensor just couldn’t read it properly. So with hearts racing, we decided to keep moving and not take any chances. Our next stop was the service center in Jaipur, where we dropped off the car for diagnostics and repairs. From there, we hopped into a taxi and headed to our hotel—Fairfield by Marriott—a calm, welcoming space we were more than ready to collapse into. Once checked in, we grabbed a light dinner, breathed a sigh of relief, and called it a night. After a day of great food, open roads, and a surprise car drama, sleep came easily—the kind you only get after a day full of unexpected turns."

Our dear friends in Jaipur had cooked up a delicious local breakfast, and we spent the morning chatting, laughing, and filling our plates (and hearts). After a warm farewell, it was time to run a quick errand—picking up a car for the next leg of our journey. Once done, we returned to the room for a short rest. The Jaipur heat was real, and a little downtime was just what we needed. Later in the day, another set of friends whisked us off to explore the Pink City—the bustling heart of Jaipur and a paradise for anyone who loves street shopping. Lanes filled with colorful fabrics, shining bangles, traditional jootis, and the aroma of local snacks tempted us at every turn. As the sun dipped and the shops started shutting their doors, we hugged our friends goodbye and headed back to our hotel, hearts full and hands (maybe a little too) full of shopping bags. It was a day of food, friends, colors, and chaos—the kind that leaves you tired in the best possible way."

    description: "The day began bright and early as we woke up, freshened up, and headed down for a quick breakfast to fuel the journey ahead. With full tummies and excited hearts, we set off toward Chandigarh, ready for another stretch of highway stories. About 4 to 5 hours into the drive, we took a detour—because when family is nearby, you don’t just pass by! We spent a lovely few hours at a relative’s home, catching up over conversations, chai, and plenty of laughter. These unplanned pauses always seem to leave the warmest memories. By late afternoon, it was time to say our goodbyes and hit the road again. As evening rolled in, we reached Zirakpur, just on the edge of Chandigarh, and checked into Radisson—our cozy stop for the night. Dinner was a proper Punjabi affair at the iconic Pal Dhaba. We ordered two kinds of chicken (because one is never enough) along with fresh, hot rotis—flavorful, comforting, and just what we needed after a long day. For dessert, we headed to a nearby softy corner. The softies, though, didn’t quite live up to the hype—melty and a bit bland—but hey, not every bite on a road trip is a win! We returned to the hotel tired but happy, ready to rest and recharge for the next chapter of our adventure."

    title: "Chandigarh to Jispa - Into the Heart of the Himalayas – With a Worry Tucked In"
    date: "2 June 2025"
    featured_image: "/assets/images/leh-main.jpg"
    description: "We kicked off the day early, setting out from Chandigarh around 7:10 AM, with the mountains calling and our spirits ready for the adventure ahead. After a few hours on the road, we took a much-needed break at a cozy roadside café called The Diaig. Steaming chai and a chilled shake were the perfect pick-me-ups as we stretched our legs and breathed in the fresh mountain air. Not long after, the Beas River joined our journey—its turquoise waters flowing gracefully beside us, as if guiding the way. The road twisted and climbed through the foothills of Himachal, with the river dancing beside us like a quiet travel companion. We had hoped to cross the famous Rohtang Pass, but to our disappointment, passes for beyond Rohtang weren’t being issued that day. Instead, we took the Atal Tunnel—a 10 km engineering marvel that slices through the mountains. The moment we emerged from its shadowy tunnel walls, it felt like stepping into a different world. The air was cooler, crisper. The landscape had changed—pine trees, snow-capped peaks, and an instant drop in temperature wrapped us in that unmistakable Himalayan embrace. Somewhere along the Chenab River, we stopped to take in the scenery. The icy water begged to be touched, the silence begged to be heard. It was one of those rare moments where time slows down and lets you just be. Eventually, winding through narrow roads and mountain valleys, we arrived at Gemur Khar Banjara, a peaceful resort nestled between Keylong and Jispa. It was picture-perfect—tucked amidst hills, with river sounds in the background and crisp, pine-scented air all around. But the beauty of the place was dulled a little by two unsettling things. First, our daughter’s condition had worsened. The altitude seemed to have triggered gastroenteritis, and she was constantly nauseous, weak, and unable to eat. Second, as if on cue, the car flashed a warning: DEF Sub-System Error. The dreaded alert meant that if we drove another 400 km without resolving it, the car would refuse to start again. And with no phone network, no workshops, and a rough, high-altitude drive to Leh ahead of us the next day, we were faced with a decision: Turn back to Chandigarh, playing it safe but undoing a week’s journey? Or press ahead to Leh, hoping the car (and we) could make it without further trouble? Night fell with more questions than answers. Wrapped in warm quilts and silence, we stared at the ceiling, each of us carrying a pocket of anxiety. Would the car start in the morning? Would our daughter feel better? Could we really make it across some of the highest motorable roads in the world without help? Tomorrow, we’d have to decide. But for tonight, we rested—hoping morning would bring clarity, courage, and a little luck."

With the DEF tank only about 60% full, maybe the sensor hadn’t been fully dipped. So I’d turned the car around and parked it facing uphill. When we started the engine in the morning… no DEF error. It felt like a small miracle. Though the general system warning light still glowed, we had no new errors. The service center had warned us not to switch off the car once it was running—it might not start again. So we made our decision: We’d drive straight to Leh. No stops. No switching off the ignition. Just one determined run across 350 km of the Himalayas. We rolled out around 7 AM, slightly behind schedule but with nerves of steel. As we climbed out of Jispa, the landscape transformed like a scene from a storybook. Fresh snow lined the roads, a soft white layer on either side, glistening in the morning light. We drove cautiously, watching for hidden ice and flowing streams—meltwater from last night’s snow. Each crossing was a mix of nerves and thrill, and though we never had to engage the 4x4, knowing it was there gave us confidence. The drive was otherworldly. Hills turned to snow-draped ridges Snow gave way to canyon-like cliffs Cliffs became gravel-strewn slopes, then hard stone passes Finally, we rolled across Martian-looking flats between mountains—vast, surreal, and silent We stopped only twice—for water and a comfort break—and each time, the altitude hit hard. Short breaths, dizziness, and pounding heads reminded us we were above 15,000 feet. The kids were pale and limp, drained of energy, and even we struggled to stay sharp. Still, we pushed forward—taking turns at the wheel, managing the road and the little ones in the backseat. Just before Leh, at Tanglang La, the highest point of the drive, we felt hopeful. The DEF error had vanished completely. But then—another twist. *Service Transmission Error*. The car was stuck in 4th gear, refusing to shift. I didn’t panic. I just adjusted—kept my speed steady at 35–40 km/h, and drove with one goal: get us to Leh, no matter what. Later, we’d learn this was “Limp Home Mode”, a safety feature that kicks in when the transmission overheats—common in thin air and steep climbs, where the cooling system can’t keep up. We crawled through the final 80 km, taking two long, tense hours. And then… we saw Leh. We reached our hotel by 5 PM, shut the engine down (finally!), and just sat in silence, breathing deeply. The drive was done. We had made it—against all odds. We ended the day with khichdi and hot soup, the simplest and most comforting meal we could imagine. Tired beyond words, a little shaken but immensely relieved, we sank into bed. That night, there were no alarms, no alerts, no more decisions. Just sleep. A wild, unforgettable chapter had closed. We were in Leh."

    description: "After the intense drive and high-altitude drama of the past few days, we had intentionally kept our first day in Leh slow and restful. The goal was simple: recover, breathe, and let the body catch up with the mountains. We began with an early breakfast, but no rushing out the door today. Everyone was still recovering—nursing headaches, fighting fatigue, and just learning to be still again. We were told that Sea Buckthorn juice was great for altitude recovery, so we stocked up and started sipping. While the rest of the crew stayed cozy at the hotel, I stepped out to check on our car. After all the error warnings and gear trouble, I was half-expecting more surprises. But to my relief, every system had reset to normal. No alerts, no flashing lights—just peace under the hood. We also found a laundry service and dropped off our growing mountain of dusty clothes. The car got its own spa treatment too—a much-needed internal and external wash after its heroic climb through snow, mud, and Martian landscapes. Later, when energy slowly returned, we strolled down to The Tibetan Kitchen, a cozy local restaurant where we tried some authentic Ladakhi and Tibetan dishes—light, hearty, and just what we needed. Our walk back took us through Leh Market, where the kids peeked into shops, and we all took in the colors, the crafts, and the easy rhythm of mountain town life. By 6:30 PM, with the golden light draping the hills, we decided on a short drive to Shanti Stupa. The winding road up offered postcard views of Leh nestled between rugged ridges, and the stillness at the top was the kind that makes you whisper, even when no one’s around. We wrapped up the day just as gently as it had begun—with khichdi, soup, and warm quilts calling us back. After everything we’d crossed to get here, Day 12 was a breath of still air—quiet, healing, and deeply grounding."

Our incredible 22 days road trip was more than just a journey across cities. It was a voyage through India’s wildly changing moods. From the sun-baked highways of Bangalore, to the sticky monsoon rains of Mumbai, the dry heat of Ahmedabad, the golden dust of Jaipur, and the cool breeze of Chandigarh. Each stop brought its own weather, its own vibe. But nothing quite prepared us for what came next: the thinning air and winding climbs of Jispa, the snow-kissed peaks of Leh, the shimmering blues of Pangong Tso, the high deserts of Nubra, and finally, the lush, pine-framed beauty of Srinagar. With every turn of the road, we felt the altitude shift, the temperature dance, and our hearts race with both awe and breathlessness. It was a test of wheels, willpower, and wonder—and we wouldn't have it any other way.

## Driving route

## Ground rules for driving safely

**No driving beyond 8 pm preferably**: We planned our travel in a way where we could choose to start early in the morning but we almost never drove after 8 pm

**Predictable hotels for a good night rest**: We did not compromise on the quality of stay at hotels to ensure we always had a good night sleep and comfortable beds. Hotels where basics and hygiene were guranteed

**Always start driving after a shower**: No matter how cold, start the morning with a warm bath to keep mind and body fresh

**Hydrate, hydrate and hydrate**: We incentivised drinking water for kids and ensured we drank enough ourselves

**Driver switch and small breaks**: We left buffer for traffic snarls and did driver switch. Took enough breaks to enjoy the journey
