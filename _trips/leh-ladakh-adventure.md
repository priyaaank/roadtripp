    description: "Pune was the first pitstop in our journey. This city was special to halt at, because we were married here, purchased our first house and Sara was born here. This is the first time we were visiting Pune as a family. On Day 1, we started at 4:45 am from Bangalore. We drove for two hours and stopped for breakfast at A2B in Sira. The food was ok, nothing to write home about. Our next stop was Big Mishra in Dharwad. Big Mishra is famous for its pedas. Along with the sweets we grabbed a quick bite. While the peda was authentic and scrumptious, food was again ok. We were greeted by heavy traffic near Kolhapur and Malkapur. The roads also had fair amount of construction and diversions along the way after Belgavi. We stopped for an early dinner at Manas restobar. Their Mutton thali is not to be missed. The paya soup was also amazing. We drove non-stop to Pune and were greeted by traffic snarls while entering the city and tool almost 2 hours to cover 25 kilometres. Overall our drive took around 14 hours or so."

    description: "We drove down from Mumbai to Ahemdabad. The started at 5:40 am, took a break at Vasai at 7 am and resumed at 9 am. We arrived in Ahemdabad at around 6:30 pm. Our route was Vasai, Vapi, Surat, Bharuch, Vadodara and Ahemdabad. The toad till Vadodara was heavy truck traffic and tiring driving experience. From Bharuch, we shifted from NH48 to NE4. The NE4 was amazing to drive on, the speed limit was 120 KM/Hr. It significantly sped up the total travel time and we recommend it. After Vadodara, we joined back NE1 or NH48 and while it was not an expressway, it was a good drive as well and this part of the journey was a pleasent drive. Overall driving time was around 12 hours from Navi Mumbai. We had a quick tea at Hotel Ahura, which we hear is great for Irani delicacies. We grabbed a tea and muska bun. It was nice. The toilets were not that clean but had Indian setup, so could be used. We grabbed our lunch at Thakkar's Hotel Jalaram Kathiyawad after Kamrej. There are many restaurants with the same name along the way, possibly a chain or different ones. While the place felt a bit dark with lack of lighting, the food and thali were fresh and definitely a value for money and tasty! The toilets were not that clean however, but had Indian option so were usable"

    description: "We woke up and went for swimming at aroud 9:30 to 10:30. It was around 37 to 40 c. Then we changed and went for breakfast. The food was okay exept for the french toast. The egg in the french toast was raw. We could not do much that afternoon cause of the heat, so we went to the cinema and watched a movie called Lilo and Stitch. It is about a hawain girl called lilo who lives with her sister, nani. One day a space creature comes and lilo acidenttaly adopts it. the movi was very good. In the evening when it got a bit cooler we went to see a flower park and the atul bridge. the place was really nice and you must visit it. We entered from gate number 3. There was no issue with the parking because there is a multylevel parking rightin front of the gate. At dinner tine we stoped at a thali place called Gordhal thal. The food was amazing and must be tried. After the amazig food we had we went to the hotel and got a goodnights rest."

Our incredible 8-day adventure through Leh Ladakh was a journey that challenged us physically while rewarding us spiritually. From the moment we landed at one of the world's highest airports to crossing the highest motorable roads, every moment as filled with wonder.

The stark beauty of the landscape - where barren mountains meet crystal-clear lakes and ancient monasteries dot the valleys - creates a sense of being on another planet. The warmth of the Ladakhi people, despite the harsh climate they call home, touched our hearts deeply.

## Highlights of Our Ladakh Journey

**Natural Wonders**: Witnessing the color-changing phenomenon of Pangong Lake, experiencing the surreal Magnetic Hill, and soaking in natural hot springs at Panamik created memories that will last forever.

**Cultural Immersion**: From morning prayers at Thiksey Monastery to traditional dance performances in Leh, we gained deep insights into Tibetan Buddhist culture and Ladakhi traditions.

**Adventure Thrills**: Crossing two of the world's highest motorable passes, camping at 14,000 feet, and riding Bactrian camels in a cold desert provided the perfect adventure rush.

**Photography Paradise**: Every turn offered frame-worthy landscapes - from prayer flags fluttering against azure skies to the reflection of snow-capped peaks in pristine lakes.

This trip taught us about resilience, spirituality, and the incredible diversity of our beautiful country. Leh Ladakh isn't just a destination; it's a transformative experience that changes how you view the world and your place in it.

*Next time, we're planning to explore the Zanskar Valley and attempt the challenging Chadar Trek on the frozen river!*
