    description: "Pune was the first pitstop in our journey. This city was special to halt at, because we were married here, purchased our first house and Sara was born here. This is the first time we were visiting Pune as a family. On Day 1, we started at 4:45 am from Bangalore. We drove for two hours and stopped for breakfast at A2B in Sira. The food was ok, nothing to write home about. Our next stop was Big Mishra in Dharwad. Big Mishra is famous for its pedas. Along with the sweets we grabbed a quick bite. While the peda was authentic and scrumptious, food was again ok. We were greeted by heavy traffic near Kolhapur and Malkapur. The roads also had fair amount of construction and diversions along the way after Belgavi. We stopped for an early dinner at Manas restobar. Their Mutton thali is not to be missed. The paya soup was also amazing. We drove non-stop to Pune and were greeted by traffic snarls while entering the city and tool almost 2 hours to cover 25 kilometres. Overall our drive took around 14 hours or so."

Our incredible 8-day adventure through Leh Ladakh was a journey that challenged us physically while rewarding us spiritually. From the moment we landed at one of the world's highest airports to crossing the highest motorable roads, every moment was filled with wonder.

The stark beauty of the landscape - where barren mountains meet crystal-clear lakes and ancient monasteries dot the valleys - creates a sense of being on another planet. The warmth of the Ladakhi people, despite the harsh climate they call home, touched our hearts deeply.

## Highlights of Our Ladakh Journey

**Natural Wonders**: Witnessing the color-changing phenomenon of Pangong Lake, experiencing the surreal Magnetic Hill, and soaking in natural hot springs at Panamik created memories that will last forever.

**Cultural Immersion**: From morning prayers at Thiksey Monastery to traditional dance performances in Leh, we gained deep insights into Tibetan Buddhist culture and Ladakhi traditions.

**Adventure Thrills**: Crossing two of the world's highest motorable passes, camping at 14,000 feet, and riding Bactrian camels in a cold desert provided the perfect adventure rush.

**Photography Paradise**: Every turn offered frame-worthy landscapes - from prayer flags fluttering against azure skies to the reflection of snow-capped peaks in pristine lakes.

This trip taught us about resilience, spirituality, and the incredible diversity of our beautiful country. Leh Ladakh isn't just a destination; it's a transformative experience that changes how you view the world and your place in it.

*Next time, we're planning to explore the Zanskar Valley and attempt the challenging Chadar Trek on the frozen river!*
