    description: "We hit the road from Bangalore at the crack of dawn—4:45 AM sharp! The skies were gentle, the breeze cool, and our spirits high. Our car was packed, playlists were ready, and the kids were snuggled in, half asleep and half excited. Our first stop? Breakfast at A2B in Sira after a couple of hours on the highway. The food filled our tummies, but let’s just say it didn’t make it to the highlight reel. With more miles to go, we cruised ahead to Dharwad and dropped by Big Mishra, famous for its legendary pedas. And oh—those soft, sweet bites were worth every calorie! We grabbed a quick snack too, but again, it was the pedas that stole the show. As we approached Kolhapur, traffic slowed us down. Cones, diversions, and roadwork popped up like surprise guests all the way from Belgavi to Satara. It felt like a zigzag obstacle course with a sprinkle of rain to keep things interesting. Hunger struck again just before sunset, and we stopped at Manas Restobar near Satara. Now this was a win! The mutton thali was pure magic, and the paya soup was the kind that warms your soul and makes your eyes roll back in delight. The last stretch into Pune tested our patience—25 km took nearly two hours thanks to the evening traffic madness. But as we finally rolled into the city, a quiet smile spread across our faces. Pune wasn’t just a stop on the map—it was where our story began. We were married here. Bought our first home here. And little Sara was born here. For the first time, we were back—as a family of four. And that made arriving in Pune feel like coming home, with the adventure just beginning."

    description: "We woke up in Pune to the kind of weather that makes you want to sip chai and hum an old Bollywood tune. After a solid night’s rest, the day began slow and sweet—breakfast, banter, and a little drive around the old neighbourhoods that still held whispers of our past. Before hitting the highway, we made a quick pitstop at a car wash. After yesterday’s 14-hour drive, the car definitely deserved a bubble bath. The kids watched the giant brushes spin like a roller coaster ride for vehicles—it was oddly satisfying! Next, it was time for hugs and hellos as we met some relatives in Pune. Smiles, snacks, stories—short but sweet. By afternoon, we were back on the road, this time heading towards Mumbai. But of course, no road trip in India is complete without the infamous toll traffic. One particular toll plaza took 45 minutes to crawl through—cue the sighs, snacks, and singalongs inside the car. As we entered Mumbai, the skies put on a dramatic show. The city was soaking in pre-monsoon showers, and the rain came down like it had a story of its own. Windshield wipers danced, the smell of wet earth filled the air, and the city welcomed us with thunder, traffic, and twinkling lights. By evening, we reached another relative’s home—our cozy nest for the night. Wet shoes at the door, warm food on the table, and familiar faces all around. Day 2 wrapped up with tired smiles, rain-soaked clothes, and hearts full of warmth."

    description: "Not every day on a road trip has to be go-go-go. Sometimes, the journey pauses—especially when the sky decides to throw a full-blown drama show! We spent two quiet days in Mumbai, staying snug at a relative’s home while the city braced for a red alert. Thunder boomed like a drumroll in the sky, and lightning flashed like someone was flicking the world's biggest light switch on and off. For those of us not used to Mumbai’s wild monsoon mood swings, it was… intense. Even the kids went from wide-eyed excitement to holding onto us during the loudest crackles of thunder. But inside the house, it was warm and cozy. We played card games, told old family stories, and watched the rain turn streets into little rivers. The break gave us time to rest, recharge, and just be with each other—no rush, no alarms, just the rhythm of the rain. Sometimes, the most memorable parts of a trip aren’t the places you see, but the unexpected pauses that help you slow down and soak it all in. Mumbai gave us one such pause—with extra thunder for effect."

    description: "We kicked off Day 5 before the sun had fully stretched—5:40 AM, wheels rolling and sky still yawning. Leaving behind a rain-drenched Mumbai, we drove through sleepy roads and made our first tea break at Vasai around 7 AM. After a two-hour pause (because: kids, tea, and wandering legs), we were back on the road by 9. Our route for the day was a who’s who of Gujarat's roadways—Vasai, Vapi, Surat, Bharuch, Vadodara, and finally, Ahmedabad. Sounds exciting? Well… not all of it. The stretch till Vadodara was a truck-lover’s dream and a driver’s patience test. Heavy traffic, slow-moving convoys, and enough honking to make a city symphony. But just as we were wondering if this was our fate for the day, we switched from NH48 to NE4 near Bharuch—and oh, what a change! NE4 felt like someone hit the “fast-forward” button. Smooth roads, wide lanes, and a posted speed limit of 120 km/h—the kids called it our personal race track (minus the racing, of course). It sliced down our drive time and gave us a chance to breathe and enjoy the ride. We rejoined NH48/NE1 after Vadodara, which wasn’t an expressway but still gave us a pleasant, easy drive. The scenery opened up, traffic thinned, and the skies played nice. Our foodie breaks deserve a spotlight too. **Tea at Hotel Ahura (near Talasari)**: Famous for Irani food, we settled for chai and maska bun—a soft, buttery hug in bread form. Yum! Toilets? Usable, but could use some love. **Lunch at Jalaram Kathiyawad Hotel, just past Kamrej**, It looked a bit dim and uninviting, but don’t judge a thali by its lighting. The food was fresh, flavorful, and pure Gujarati goodness. Again, toilets were just okay, but functional. By 6:30 PM, after nearly 12 hours on the road, we rolled into Ahmedabad—tired, dusty, but satisfied. This leg of the journey was all about contrasts: slow trucks and zippy expressways, plain tea and rich thalis, and the joy of watching the landscape shift with every hour."

    description: "We woke up to a warm Ahmedabad morning—warm, as in nearly 40°C! So naturally, the only sensible thing to do was dive into the pool. From 9:30 to 10:30 AM, the kids splashed, the grown-ups floated, and the sun did its thing from above. A great way to kick off a hot day! Post-swim, we headed for breakfast. It was alright—nothing fancy—but let’s just say the French toast could’ve used a little more love (and cooking). The egg was a bit too raw for our liking, but we chalked it up to the adventure of travel food! By noon, the sun was on full blast. Stepping outside felt like walking into a giant hairdryer. So we found the perfect escape: a cool, dark movie theatre! We watched Lilo & Stitch, a heartwarming tale of Lilo, a Hawaiian girl, and Stitch, a mischievous alien she accidentally adopts. The kids were glued to the screen, and let’s be honest—so were we. There’s something magical about watching found-family stories while traveling with your own. As evening rolled in and the heat took a break, we ventured out to explore Atal Bridge and the Flower Garden by the riverfront. We entered through Gate 3, which had convenient multilevel parking right across—no circling around in frustration! The garden was bursting with color, and the Atal Bridge looked stunning against the evening sky. With the Sabarmati flowing below and a breeze finally in the air, it was the kind of outing that makes you forget the heat ever existed. Dinner took the crown though—Gordhan Thal, a traditional thali place. The food was phenomenal, a real celebration of Gujarati flavors. Each dish was a burst of taste, and we left the place grinning and stuffed. Back at the hotel, bellies full and feet tired, we fell asleep almost instantly. Day 6 in Ahmedabad was hot, sweet, and colorful—just like the city itself."

And that is exactly what we did. The df tank had actualy not run out of df, it was just that the sensor was not able to sense the df.

Our dear friends in Jaipur had cooked up a delicious local breakfast, and we spent the morning chatting, laughing, and filling our plates (and hearts). After a warm farewell, it was time to run a quick errand—picking up a car for the next leg of our journey. Once done, we returned to the room for a short rest. The Jaipur heat was real, and a little downtime was just what we needed. Later in the day, another set of friends whisked us off to explore the Pink City—the bustling heart of Jaipur and a paradise for anyone who loves street shopping. Lanes filled with colorful fabrics, shining bangles, traditional jootis, and the aroma of local snacks tempted us at every turn. As the sun dipped and the shops started shutting their doors, we hugged our friends goodbye and headed back to our hotel, hearts full and hands (maybe a little too) full of shopping bags. It was a day of food, friends, colors, and chaos—the kind that leaves you tired in the best possible way."

With full tummies and excited hearts, we set off toward Chandigarh, ready for another stretch of highway stories. About 4 to 5 hours into the drive, we took a detour—because when family is nearby, you don’t just pass by! We spent a lovely few hours at a relative’s home, catching up over conversations, chai, and plenty of laughter. These unplanned pauses always seem to leave the warmest memories. By late afternoon, it was time to say our goodbyes and hit the road again. As evening rolled in, we reached Zirakpur, just on the edge of Chandigarh, and checked into Radisson—our cozy stop for the night. Dinner was a proper Punjabi affair at the iconic Pal Dhaba. We ordered two kinds of chicken (because one is never enough) along with fresh, hot rotis—flavorful, comforting, and just what we needed after a long day. For dessert, we headed to a nearby softy corner. The softies, though, didn’t quite live up to the hype—melty and a bit bland—but hey, not every bite on a road trip is a win! We returned to the hotel tired but happy, ready to rest and recharge for the next chapter of our adventure."

Our incredible 22 days road trip was more than just a journey across cities. It was a voyage through India’s wildly changing moods. From the sun-baked highways of Bangalore, to the sticky monsoon rains of Mumbai, the dry heat of Ahmedabad, the golden dust of Jaipur, and the cool breeze of Chandigarh. Each stop brought its own weather, its own vibe. But nothing quite prepared us for what came next: the thinning air and winding climbs of Jispa, the snow-kissed peaks of Leh, the shimmering blues of Pangong Tso, the high deserts of Nubra, and finally, the lush, pine-framed beauty of Srinagar. With every turn of the road, we felt the altitude shift, the temperature dance, and our hearts race with both awe and breathlessness. It was a test of wheels, willpower, and wonder—and we wouldn't have it any other way.

## Driving route 

🚘 Bengaluru > Pune > Mumbai > Ahmedabad > Jaipur > Chandigarh > Jispa > Leh > Pangong Tso > Nubra Valley > Srinagar > Chandigarh > Bengaluru 🏁


## Ground rules for driving safely

**No driving beyond 8 pm preferably**: We planned our travel in a way where we could choose to start early in the morning but we almost never drove after 8 pm

**Predictable hotels for a good night rest**: We did not compromise on the quality of stay at hotels to ensure we always had a good night sleep and comfortable beds. Hotels where basics and hygiene were guranteed

**Always start driving after a shower**: No matter how cold, start the morning with a warm bath to keep mind and body fresh

**Hydrate, hydrate and hydrate**: We incentivised drinking water for kids and ensured we drank enough ourselves

**Driver switch and small breaks**: We left buffer for traffic snarls and did driver switch. Took enough breaks to enjoy the journey
