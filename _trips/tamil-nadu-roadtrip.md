    description: "Our trip began early, at 6:15 am from Bangalore, with Rameshwaram as the destination. This was the longest drive of the journey, so we made sure to start with full energy. By 8 am we stopped at Murugan Idli on NH44, a place already buzzing with people. Breakfast was a proper South Indian spread‚Äîpodi idlis dripping with ghee, sweet pongal, dosa, uttapam, and strong filter coffee. A perfect start!<br/><br/>From there, the road took us through Krishnagiri, Salem, Namakkal, Karur, Dindigul, Madurai, Ramanathapuram, and finally Rameshwaram. The entire drive took about 10.5 hours, including a long lunch break in Madurai. We ate at New Shree Ram Mess‚Äîfresh, tasty food with enough parking nearby, which was a relief when traveling with kids. Traffic wasn‚Äôt too bad except while leaving Bangalore and later inside Madurai city.<br/><br/>The most exciting part was crossing the Pamban Bridge before entering Rameshwaram. The sea on both sides, dotted with colorful fishing boats, made the drive absolutely scenic and memorable.<br/><br/>Once we reached, we stopped for tea and a short break before heading out. Our first stop was Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam‚Äôs house, a simple yet inspiring place that reminded us of his humble beginnings. For dinner, we decided to be adventurous and tried a small local eatery called Jaya Seafood. The place was basic, but the seafood was fresh and cooked right in front of us. We ordered pomfret and prawns, which turned out delicious, though a bit oily. The highlight was the shrimps with Kerala parotta‚Äîan unexpectedly great combo!<br/><br/>We ended the day at our hotel, Boomerang, which was new, clean, and very comfortable. The service was warm and welcoming‚Äîjust what we needed after a long day on the road."

      review: "A recently built hotel with spacious, functional rooms that feels fresh and well maintained. The real highlight, though, is the warm and attentive service ‚Äî every staff member is cheerful and eager to help. The property has a clean pool and is managed well, though the in-house kitchen wasn‚Äôt operational during our stay. To make up for it, the team happily arranged food from different restaurants outside and ensured it was delivered just the way we wanted. Conveniently located between Rameswaram town and the Pamban Bridge, it‚Äôs a practical and value-for-money choice that I‚Äôd recommend"

      - name: "Murugan Idli"
        location: "Murugan Idli Shop, Binapalli Village, NH 44"
        comment: "Famous for its Podi Idli and Sweet Pongal the breakfast dishes are soaked in ghee and podi masala. They are a must try if you like rich south indian dishes. Sweet Pongal made from jaggery, cahswes and other rich ingredients are worth sampling even if you have never tried before. It gets crazy crowded after 8 am with often wait times extending to 30 minutes and more. So recommedn that you reach by 7:30 am or so to beat the traffic"
      - name: "New Sri Ram Mess"
        location: "New Sri Ram Mess Madurai"
        comment: "A humble setup with AC and Non AC seating areas. The Thali cost was around INR 150 per person. With great service, freshly prepared food that was delicious and local. Highly recommended if you are looking for a fixed menu, all vegeterian and a quick turn around. There is also a car parking nearby on the same street if you are driving down"
      - name: "Jaya Seafood"
        location: "Hotel Sangeeth Palace, Rameshwaram"
        comment: "It is a small hole in the wall. Not marked on the map however very close to Hotel Sangeeth Palace. Look on your left (if Hotel Sangeeth Palace is on your left) and find Jaya Seafood. Great service and people. You should be willing to compromise on the setup of the kitchen and area for freshly prepared food. A bit oily"
    additional_considerations: "The toll road costed around 700-800 INR between Bangalore and Rameshwaram. You can park the car at the Rameshwaram end of Pamban bridge and walk down to the middle to observe the old and the new bridges on the train track that have been built to let the ships pass. Plan for Madurai as the food stopover. If you would like temple visit as well, you will need to plan better and start earlier"

Our 10-day road trip along the Konkan coast took us from Mangaluru and Udupi to Padubidri, Gokarna, and finally all the way to Goa. The drive was full of moments where rivers quietly met the Arabian Sea, opening up to calm and endless views of the water. We found some of the cleanest and most untouched beaches in the country, dipped our feet in the sea whenever we got the chance, and happily indulged in local food and fresh seafood all through the journey
