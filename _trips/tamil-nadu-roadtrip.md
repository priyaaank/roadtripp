      review: "A recently built hotel with spacious, functional rooms that feels fresh and well maintained. The real highlight, though, is the warm and attentive service ‚Äî every staff member is cheerful and eager to help. The property has a clean pool and is managed well, though the in-house kitchen wasn‚Äôt operational during our stay. To make up for it, the team happily arranged food from different restaurants outside and ensured it was delivered just the way we wanted. Conveniently located between Rameswaram town and the Pamban Bridge, it‚Äôs a practical and value-for-money choice that I‚Äôd recommend"

        comment: "Famous for its Podi Idli and Sweet Pongal the breakfast dishes are soaked in ghee and podi masala. They are a must try if you like rich south indian dishes. Sweet Pongal made from jaggery, cahswes and other rich ingredients are worth sampling even if you have never tried before. It gets crazy crowded after 8 am with often wait times extending to 30 minutes and more. So recommedn that you reach by 7:30 am or so to beat the traffic"

    additional_considerations: "If you start early from Bengaluru, you can reach Mangaluru in good time, with constructions over hopefully and even the day 1 can be used for a bit of sight seeing, if planned properly"

Our 10-day road trip along the Konkan coast took us from Mangaluru and Udupi to Padubidri, Gokarna, and finally all the way to Goa. The drive was full of moments where rivers quietly met the Arabian Sea, opening up to calm and endless views of the water. We found some of the cleanest and most untouched beaches in the country, dipped our feet in the sea whenever we got the chance, and happily indulged in local food and fresh seafood all through the journey
