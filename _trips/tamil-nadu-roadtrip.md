    description: "Our trip began early, at 6:15 am from Bangalore, with Rameshwaram as the destination. This was the longest drive of the journey, so we made sure to start with full energy. By 8 am we stopped at Murugan Idli on NH44, a place already buzzing with people. Breakfast was a proper South Indian spread—podi idlis dripping with ghee, sweet pongal, dosa, uttapam, and strong filter coffee. A perfect start!<br/><br/>From there, the road took us through Krishnagiri, Salem, Namakkal, Karur, Dindigul, Madurai, Ramanathapuram, and finally Rameshwaram. The entire drive took about 10.5 hours, including a long lunch break in Madurai. We ate at New Shree Ram Mess—fresh, tasty food with enough parking nearby, which was a relief when traveling with kids. Traffic wasn’t too bad except while leaving Bangalore and later inside Madurai city.<br/><br/>The most exciting part was crossing the Pamban Bridge before entering Rameshwaram. The sea on both sides, dotted with colorful fishing boats, made the drive absolutely scenic and memorable.<br/><br/>Once we reached, we stopped for tea and a short break before heading out. Our first stop was Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam’s house, a simple yet inspiring place that reminded us of his humble beginnings. For dinner, we decided to be adventurous and tried a small local eatery called Jaya Seafood. The place was basic, but the seafood was fresh and cooked right in front of us. We ordered pomfret and prawns, which turned out delicious, though a bit oily. The highlight was the shrimps with Kerala parotta—an unexpectedly great combo!<br/><br/>We ended the day at our hotel, Boomerang, which was new, clean, and very comfortable. The service was warm and welcoming—just what we needed after a long day on the road."

      review: "A recently built hotel with spacious, functional rooms that feels fresh and well maintained. The real highlight, though, is the warm and attentive service — every staff member is cheerful and eager to help. The property has a clean pool and is managed well, though the in-house kitchen wasn’t operational during our stay. To make up for it, the team happily arranged food from different restaurants outside and ensured it was delivered just the way we wanted. Conveniently located between Rameswaram town and the Pamban Bridge, it’s a practical and value-for-money choice that I’d recommend"

        comment: "Famous for its Podi Idli and Sweet Pongal the breakfast dishes are soaked in ghee and podi masala. They are a must try if you like rich south indian dishes. Sweet Pongal made from jaggery, cahswes and other rich ingredients are worth sampling even if you have never tried before. It gets crazy crowded after 8 am with often wait times extending to 30 minutes and more. So recommedn that you reach by 7:30 am or so to beat the traffic"

        comment: "A humble setup with AC and Non AC seating areas. The Thali cost was around INR 150 per person. With great service, freshly prepared food that was delicious and local. Highly recommended if you are looking for a fixed menu, all vegeterian and a quick turn around. There is also a car parking nearby on the same street if you are driving down"
      - name: "Jaya Seafood"
        location: "Hotel Sangeeth Palace, Rameshwaram"
        comment: "It is a small hole in the wall. Not marked on the map however very close to Hotel Sangeeth Palace. Look on your left (if Hotel Sangeeth Palace is on your left) and find Jaya Seafood. Great service and people. You should be willing to compromise on the setup of the kitchen and area for freshly prepared food. A bit oily"
    additional_considerations: "The toll road costed around 700-800 INR between Bangalore and Rameshwaram. You can park the car at the Rameshwaram end of Pamban bridge and walk down to the middle to observe the old and the new bridges on the train track that have been built to let the ships pass. Plan for Madurai as the food stopover. If you would like temple visit as well, you will need to plan better and start earlier"

    title: "Dhanushkodi, Sea Breeze & A Train over the Pamban"
    date: "26 Oct 2025"
    featured_image: "/assets/images/tamil-nadu/day2-lhviewparanomic.jpg"
    description: "After a relaxed breakfast at the hotel, we decided to keep the day light but interesting. Our plan was simple: drive to Dhanushkodi, visit the lighthouse, try some water sports, take the train ride over the Pamban Bridge, and wrap it all up with a nice dinner.<br/><br/>We started around 9 am, and the drive to Dhanushkodi was an experience in itself. The road is flanked by the sea on both sides—one side with restless waves crashing hard, the other side calm and flat like a lake. Even the kids noticed the stark contrast and kept pointing it out. We stopped at a small beach with a steep slope into the water, splashed around for a bit, and clicked a few pictures before moving on.<br/><br/>The Dhanushkodi Lighthouse was our next stop. Unlike old lighthouses where you climb up spiral staircases, this one had a lift, managed by staff who let visitors up in batches. From the top, the view was spectacular—salty wind blowing hard on our faces and endless blue on all sides. Looking down, we could spot the remains of the “ghost town” of Dhanushkodi, which was wiped out in the 1964 cyclone. The ruins of churches and houses are still half-buried in the sand, standing as a quiet reminder of what once was. (Access to the actual light is restricted now; visitors are only allowed up to the viewing floor.)<br/><br/>We had hoped for water sports next, but since the tide was low, most activities were shut. Luckily, snorkeling was still available. The kids were thrilled to get into the sea, and we managed to spot corals, colorful fish, sea cucumbers, and even urchins. The corals here are large but not as vibrant as we had imagined. Still, it was a fun, refreshing experience.<br/><br/>By lunch, we were famished. We headed back to the hotel and ordered food in from a nearby restaurant. A short rest later, it was time for the part we were most excited about—the train journey over the Pamban Bridge.<br/><br/>We bought general tickets for just ₹94 for two adults and boarded the 4:30 pm train from Rameshwaram station. The general coach was crowded, so we stood near the open gate for the best view. Pro tip for future travelers: since Rameshwaram is the starting point, sleeper coaches are usually empty—you can buy sleeper or even general tickets and sit there comfortably until ticket checking begins. Don’t book AC, though—the windows are sealed and you’ll miss the magic.<br/><br/>As the train slowly crossed the bridge, it felt surreal. Water stretched endlessly on both sides, fishing boats looked like toy models, and the salty breeze rushed in. The kids were wide-eyed, and honestly, so were we. On the other side, we got off at Mandapam, the first town after the bridge, and took an auto back to Rameshwaram (₹500 for the ride).<br/><br/>We picked up our car from the station, stopped for filter coffee, and ended the day with dinner at Ahaan Restaurant (Daiwik Hotels). Instead of the buffet, we went with à la carte—service was a bit slow since they were understaffed that day, but the food was good. By the time we returned to our hotel, everyone was ready to crash after a full and satisfying day."

        comment: "The restaurant itself was a wierd setup, a very large hall that looked like a Banquet hall turned restaurant. The service was a bit slow, however the food was ok. We tried vegeterian dishes and they were all decently good. If you are looking for a mid range place to try with predictable food, then we recommend it. Don't expect stellar service or fantastic ambience"
    additional_considerations: "The beach at Dhanushkodi has a steep slope, so keep a close watch on kids when they play near the water. The lighthouse now uses a lift, so elderly visitors will find it easier to go up, but access to the top light is not allowed. Water activities depend heavily on tides—call ahead if snorkeling or boating is a priority. For the train ride over Pamban, avoid AC tickets; sleeper class offers comfort with open windows, while general class guarantees energy and views if you don’t mind the crowd. Autos from Mandapam to Rameshwaram can be pricey, so check rates beforehand or arrange a pickup"

Our 10-day road trip along the Konkan coast took us from Mangaluru and Udupi to Padubidri, Gokarna, and finally all the way to Goa. The drive was full of moments where rivers quietly met the Arabian Sea, opening up to calm and endless views of the water. We found some of the cleanest and most untouched beaches in the country, dipped our feet in the sea whenever we got the chance, and happily indulged in local food and fresh seafood all through the journey
