A 3-day weekend trip took us through Kumbakonam, Thanjavur, and nearby towns, where we explored the magnificent architectural legacy of the Cholas. Some temples were still alive with daily prayers, while others stood as UNESCO heritage sites drawing tourists from everywhere. We wandered through temple walls, gardens, ancient wells, and tanks, discovered local food havens and art corners, and delighted in the mythical tales that added a touch of mystery and fun to our journey.
