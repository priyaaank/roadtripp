## Image Guidelines

### Recommended Sizes:
- **Main trip images**: 1200x800px
- **Day featured images**: 800x600px
- **Photo gallery images**: 600x400px
- **Timeline images**: Should be roughly square (400x400px works well)

### Formats:
- JPEG for photographs
- PNG for graphics with transparency
- WebP for better compression (with JPEG fallback)

### File Naming:
- Use lowercase letters and hyphens
- Be descriptive: `grand-canyon-sunset.jpg` vs `img001.jpg`
- Keep names reasonably short

### Optimization:
- Compress images for web (80-90% quality for JPEG)
- Consider using tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim
- Responsive images: Consider multiple sizes for different screen resolutions

## Temporary Solution

Until you add your own images, you can:
1. Use placeholder image services like `https://picsum.photos/800/600` in your markdown files
2. Download royalty-free images from Unsplash or Pexels
3. Use your own trip photos (recommended!)

## Adding Your Images

1. Save your images to this `assets/images/` directory
2. Update the image paths in your trip markdown files
3. Ensure the filenames match what's referenced in your content
4. Test locally with `bundle exec jekyll serve`

Remember to respect copyright and only use images you have permission to use!
